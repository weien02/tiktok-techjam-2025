Pork skin is so soft yet with texture.
The herbal soup is amazing strong for herbal lovers.

Our most favourite is the dry Kway Chap.
Die die must try!

Not to mention the boss is so attentive and generous.
Quality food at very affordable prices.

It also cooked with shredded cabbage, lending it a nice aroma.

Braised peanut, Tofu and hard boiled egg which were good but not outstanding.

Duck was outstanding. It had a bite and great flavors.

Soup had a medicinal flavor and was robust tasting.

A surprising find in an obscured area of this tiny island."

Duck meat was tender and well braised, a mild herbal taste drenched with thick braised savoury herbal savoury sweet sauce. Yam rice was a bit dry, but goes went with the braised sauce.

The Edinger dark was not right, sour  tast. The restaurant later mentioned the barrel has been two days.

I need to start developing a new checklist to ask, e.g., the freshness of the draft before ordering (also recommended to you :-). It would be good to offer me discount or replacement of the non fresh, even I asked for. Service and food rate can go higher with these considerations.

Really nice and fresh draft Tiger beer."

The only disappointment was the fact that we were discouraged from ordering local Chinese fare as we were explained that it may take a long time as food is prepared by Chinese restaurant upstairs.
Well the saving grace is the 10% discount offered to cyclists."

I placed my order at 12:40 PM and my food was served at almost 1:30 PM. The wait was incredibly long and by the time the food arrived, most of it was cold.

On top of that, the prices were far too high for the quality and portion sizes.
Overall, I was really dissatisfied and won't be returning."

Staff at doors explained too much when I asked for a seat at the deck, talking about what's fair and what's not. Like I don't need it. Just say it's reserved, it's good enough.
Another nice indian server was great in changing my seat.

Not just for its location but equally for its food and their service.

Food, was absolutely delicious. I enjoyed every bite of the food we had that I forgot to even capture pictures of the main dishes. They have a good variety of vegetarian and meat based dishes. And the spice level wasn't too bad. Portion is size is also perfect for one. We tried their shawarma roll with fries, rice noodles with vegetables and mock meat along with pasta. Soup and lava cake for starter and dessert. I really can say there was anything that I didn't like about the food. Service time was also quite decent. What I liked all the more was, they checked with us prior to bringing out the dessert so that was very thoughtful of them. I have been to places where dessert has served first on the table, so this gesture was nice.

Staffs are amazing, very helpful and very friendly.

Price wise also I would say it's affordable and not too high. So that's another plus

As it's outdoor dining with nets surrounding, one might find lizards climbing on the nets. If you're not comfortable with that then the best seat to take would be in the middle. Other than that, you will enjoy your time."

Overlooking a marina, the al-fresco restaurant was slightly elevated above the marina below, providing a nice view of the marina, the bobbling boats and the hustle and bustle on the pier.
The restaurant has a canvas roof, and has no wall, allowing an unobstructed view of the marina and the sea. Do come in the later part of the evening though, as the restaurant receives the full glare of the setting sun.
The service
The service was cursory and indifferent, especially when the restaurant started to fill up.
The food
The food here consisted of the usual cafe fare - laksa, fish & chips, pork chops and nasi goreng etc.
I had:
Lamb shank briyani: The lamb shank was tender, easily separated from the bone and provided the perfect complement to the bed of fragrant bismati rice. The rice was redolent of aromatic spices and not too overly oily.
The beer: the drink menu here were rather limited (just two draft beer). The tiger beer was rather unexciting though.
In conclusion - come here for the view."

I wanted to recee for wedding site, so I stayed for a night.

To be frank, the place have seen better days, some of the furnishings and carpets are showing their age. Can especially be seen in pool with a few broken tiles.

That said, I love the tranquility and the opportunity to visit the famous Raffles lighthouse.

It is quite apparent, how the number of staff, especially in the Bistro, have reduced, over the last several years.

Despite the reduction in staff, the excellent quality of service has been maintained especially during peak hours. However, in the past months, we have noticed that no managers were on duty, especially over the weekends, or public holidays.

We have noticed that when certain matters that require managerial attention, the general staff have to bear the brunt of pacifying unhappy customers.

This is extremely concerning as this will be stressing the ground staff out tremendously, when all of which could have been avoided, if the duty manager were around, during peak periods like weekend dinner.

We sincerely hope, you in senior management, can do something to alleviate the situation, and prevent long term efficient staff from leaving."

Located in Tuas West, this restaurant is located in a 'ulu' industrial flat, amongst factories and industrial buildings.
The Place:
The hugh dining hall was decorated with many posters of food and LED wordings on the walls, which, together with the plastic plants, seem somewhat crowded and tacky. The bar counter was too crowded with equipments and utensils, and was overshadowed by the large posters hanging over it. The decor could improve with a better interior designer.
The Food
I had the truffles olio aglio pasta with New Zealand ribeye. The pasta was perfectly cooked, with a nice degree of al-dente. The truffles oil add a hint of umami to the olive oil-based sauce, without overpowering it. The ribeye was a bit tough, probably due to the lack of marbling of the New Zealand steak, but was well cooked and not dry, attesting to the skill and care of the chef. The addition of black cavier on the steak, although did not add to the flavour, however did enhance the presentation of the dish. The restaurant was having a promotion of Japanese oysters - $1 for each raw oyster. The plump oyster tasted full of briny freshness, and was creamy in textual.
Conclusion
It is worth a visit if you are around the area."

Also enjoyed their fried chicken wing(tender and juicy) and pepperoni pizza (super generous amount of pepperoni) very much.

Considering the prices of the items would be slightly higher considering the location, coz even stay in Jurong it took 15-20 mins drive. But well compensated the price with good quality and portions.

Other catch is definitely the freshness of the seafood!! Tried the seafood on the table and I loved the seafood + lobsters. Expect to order extra buns tho.

2. The Beancurd with pork floss met our expectations. (Photo not shown due to bad image quality)
3. The Omelette is nice and highly recommended.
4. The Har Lok, also from the hidden menu, was big and fresh, but the sauce didn't meet expectations, according to my friend.

For the price, all are okay except those in the hidden menu. It's our fault for not asking for the price, but the waitress should also have warned us before we ordered. Items from the hidden menu are not so worth it considering their value.

The atmosphere is pleasant, and the staff are friendly, although the counter lady showed impatience when we talked to her."

They manage to get the perfect balance amount of the alcohol (I suppose XO?) that enhances the richness of the soup.

The fish slices were fresh and come in thick chunks. They do not have fried fish version. The premium soup also included meat patties. No doubt they were good, but given a choice, I will exchange the meat patties with more fish slices. I want to eat fish soup for the fish and soup, and not for the unnecessary meat patties.

The zichar taste awesome too, except maybe for the chilli sauce used for cooking the petai. Too sweet to my liking.

Definitely my new fav fish soup venue."

We ordered a fish soup each. We all enjoyed the food, and they also provided complimentary fruit after the meal.

When we were making the payment, one of soup - mutton with fish soup (#12 on the menu), which is stated at $20 on the menu, was charged for $30.

The cashier claimed that the price on the menu was not updated. Well, we have already finished the food and have no point to argue.

Just a word of caution, do double check with the staff on the price when you are ordering."

Usually quite popular with the lunch crowd in the Tuas area as this is the only decent restaurant besides raffles Marina.

The alcohol is not expensive. When it comes to the weekend they have 1-1 promo or buy 5 get 2 free.

Oysters: plump, crunchy, not the gooey kind.  The size is typically 3 dollars a piece. It taste fresh, nowhere not like the orh lua from the hawker centre.

Chicken cutlet: while I doubt any food establishment uses fresh chicken thigh, the chicken is juicy and very well breaded. It was not hammered to look big.

American coleslaw: they adjusted the flavour very well.  The coleslaw was not dripping. They took care to ensure the veggies were completely dry and I am quite sure not overnight. The mayo also tasted unique. The ratio of raisins were perfect.  I really dislike American coleslaw that dump in too much raisins to make the dish feel expensive.

Pasta with black pepper curry leaves: very unique flavour that I did not expect to turn out well. It turned out to be a dish that I will come back just to repeat the order.

I will visit again since I am just 20 minutes away. However if you are in the central or east area, you may want to try once and be your own judge."

For the lunch menu, it has a lot of side dishes to order example gyoza, tamagoyaki, edamame, tori karaage, salad, ebi tempura, and miso soup.

The don set can upgrade to set by adding $3 for any 2 sides to choose.

We had 13 pax, and we set in a corner. Table full of food.

For the dinner menu, it has other varieties, including the yakitori.

An interesting restaurant in the western part of Singapore. There are a total of 3.... One at Joon Koon interchange, one at Gek Poh ( closed as of Sep 24) and the biggest one  at D'Arena. The D' arena should be their flagship stall as the area serves a bigger crowd (round table that sits 10) while the others are catered to smaller lunch crowd.

One interesting thing about their flagship stall is that their have more stuff and zhi char dishes..... some unique offering is mutton fish soup. Have yet to try but might give it a go one day. Their fish soup and other dishes are pretty good as well. Worth a try when you are in the area."

I think the level of spiceness and mix is above average.

USP is that they fry some of the ingredients like fish, potato, and lotus. But it‚Äôs heavy and they charged by the weight. So imagine getting your eggs, lotus and potato. Heavier than meat üòÇ However, I probably wouldn‚Äôt reorder the fried items as they were quite dry and oily, with no seasoning or marination.

They offer the option to fry some ingredients - which I opt for the potato to be fried into potato chips, seasoned with their special seasoning (similar to China kinda chuan chuan powder with a BBQ-spicy kick) were super flavorful!

The variety is great, and the pricing is pretty affordable with no min. weight required. While the scrambled egg was a novelty, I didn‚Äôt find it paired that well... (personal opinion).

Spice levels are definitely on the hotter side‚Äî I usually go for medium, but I might drop a level next time. And surprisingly, the Thai green milk tea was the highlight for me! It might seem like a strange combo, but it really hit the spot!!!"

Ordering is easy via a self-order kiosk where you weigh the ingredients and pick ur soup base/frying style. The scrambled eggs is a must add. There is indeed a fly problem at the ingredients area, even though we arrived early at 11 and the staff had just stocked the ingredients. Overall the food was good and the mala collagen soup style is very unique and tasty."

It was a quiet Sunday afternoon. At all contact points, the staff were rude and condescending. Some of us were choosing food and the rest sat at the table and waited. The Manager came over and reprimanded us. He said we cannot just sit down. In future,  we must choose our food and drinks before we sat down.

1. The tone was condescending to the point as if we committed an illegal act.
2. So the whole big group is supposed to stand in line and crowd over the bowl for selection before sitting down.
3. There was no crowd and no one in the queue so early on Sunday.

Very disappointed with the service. There are many other outlets available, and in fact, many other brand options. Buck up or lose the biz. That's all

Review from 1st visit in 2023:
Staff were very helpful and friendly. Food was served promptly. Ordering was simple via the automated kiosk. Payment was by electronic means only. No cash accepted.

Food was reasonably priced and really very tasty. Tomato collagen soup was thick and conforting to the tummy. Scrambled egg and fried potato chips were definitely highlights. Thai milk tea was very nice and staff saved the day by telling me to have ice in milk tea or it will be very sweet. Had an enjoyable lunch! Will be back again!"

Good thing we came early slightly before 11.30am, cause the restaurant was quickly filled up after we came. 1st time we had fried potato & lotus chips. Mala collagen soup was fantastic. Just the right amount of spice and hotness. Ingredients were fresh too.

The staff have some fixed SOP, ie, queue at door when there is a earlier group picking ingredients. Have to pick ingredients before seating down.

Lady server thought wife was PRC. Told my wife something, then immediately repeated the same thing in mandarin. I think it was quite unnecessary to do so. Didn't even wait for us to reply. (-1 star)"

Tried a variety of dishes for dinner. They have a good spread of options, and the flavours striking in a way that speaks to their authenticity while being affordable.

Their dishes were great. The standout was the steamed sea bass, the fish was fresh, the texture was delicate but robust. Their vegetables were well seasoned, with stir fried beans crisp and flavourful. The egg and tomato was a simple dish but was no less satisfying.

Their food also did not shy away in the spice area, with the heat making a balanced roundness to the dishes without being overpowering. For those not well acquainted with spice, I‚Äôm sure they are amenable to requests to taper the kick. Though I do recommend it for the experience.

Service was prompt and attentive, complementing the dishes served. Would come again. They also have private rooms with KTV systems."

I ordered the chicken paitan ramen which comes with 2 slices of chashu, an hanjuku egg, some bamboo shoots and 2 slices of seaweed above a bed of noodles.

I‚Äôm writing this two hours after lunch - and have yet eaten anything else but the soup is a lil heavy handed on the MSG. And I crave „Åø„Åö„ÄÇ Otherwise, the soup was pretty one dimensional - it‚Äôs not as creamy and tasted like Chinese chicken soup sans the herbs. Idk but maybe more greens (or corn) simmered in the stock would give it more personality.

The noodles were, strangely, eggy - and was a lil tough for my liking. Chashu was okay. Egg was slightly over cooked so some parts of the yolks were cooked. I wished there were more bamboo shoots.

I also had the daifuku as desserts. Order the yuzu one; it‚Äôs tart and springy.

Can‚Äôt wait to try the dinner offerings one day!"

Ordered both the mala collagen soup version and the mala stir fry dry version.

The stir fry dry version was a tad bit salty and needed a bit of drinks to wash down the taste. Adding on scrambled eggs on top definitely made the dish special and even nicer!

The soup version was overall more balanced, easy on the palate, only comment i could say is i wish the soup was served hotter( at a higher temperature), felt as If the soup cooled down way too fast, but it was otherwise very enjoyable!"

You can choose to customise the way of cooking and type of soup to your liking. Highly recommend having the mala collagen soup and adding the scrambled egg. Soup is flavour and delicious. Egg is creamy and has a wok hey. The fried stuff are really delicious too but they turn soggy quickly. Staff are really helpful and friendly.

All I wanted is to skip the queue by choosing take-away instead but we were told to queue up until all the front customer has been seated.

Honestly, I‚Äôm a little skeptical about them frying the potato and lotus that we picked. Because most of the potatoes and lotus root were so HUGE. When we got served, the portion size after it got fried was questionable. It wasn‚Äôt hot when we were eating it, preparation time was too fast (within 10 minutes). Imagine the kitchen needs to cut and fry them within the timeframe. ü§î

Other than that, I enjoyed the tomato soup though but the dry mala personally I think CMI.

Overall experience is pretty neutral. You will pay a premium price for an average mala if you order those veg with high water content. I won‚Äôt recommend you guys to consider trying them. But tomato soup or mala tang option won‚Äôt go wrong."

Standards have dropped with each visit. The previous time we patronised the Sembawang branch, the lotus root and potato were both soggy. This time round, we took a huge lotus root but barely got served ANY. Do they pre-fry their lotus root and potato, and serve you if you select those ingredients? If so, why are they charging us for the weight of the items when they‚Äôre not serving the proportionate amount? Disappointing meal once again."

Following the signage and direction boards, we easily located the establishment. Our visit took place on a weekend late afternoon, and we were among only three patrons at that time.
We thoroughly enjoyed the restaurant's vibe and the background music. Our order included the Slow Cooked Beef Cheek, Fish & Chips, Honey Mustard Chicken Leg, Meat Beef Ragu Pasta, and the highly recommended Lava Torte for dessert. All dishes were impeccably prepared, with each item reaching the perfect level of tenderness and harmonizing well with its respective sauces. It's challenging to pinpoint a single ""Must Try"" item, as every dish was truly worth sampling.

Among our favorites was the Chocolate Baked Lava Cake, exuding a delightful fragrance of chocolate and mild milk. Served piping hot and paired with cold vanilla ice cream, each bite resulted in a satisfying melding of flavors that melted in our mouths.

The waitstaff and entire crew were not only friendly but also deserving of a double thumbs up for their excellent service. Our visit to Pen & INC proved to be a delightful and memorable experience, making for a wonderful afternoon."

18 Sep 24 - Order prawn fajita. While the prawns were plentiful, it didn't taste fresh. Banana cake was nice though.

23 Sep 24 - Ordered fish and chips. The fish and chips were too dry for my liking. Furthermore, it cost $22 after GST and service charge for this plate. At most, I would pay is $12 at most."

A sports bar cafe and restaurant situated near one-North MRT. When we visited the place is so quiet ü•π

We ordered calamari for appetizer, it was quite okay, the squid was just overcooked but the fry is golden to perfection.

The wagyu cheeseburger is a must! Very meaty and juicy, the meat was thick also! We liked the fries for the side. üçî

For the pan seared salmon, you cannot go wrong with salmon. Cooked with freshness and the tangy lemon flavor compliments it more. The mash potato was so smooth but quite bland; but still manage to go well with the salmon.

For the pasta, there's a taste of burn garlic but the creaminess and the amount of serving is good. üíØ

All in all, we enjoyed our time together, we step out of the cafe feeling full and satisfied. Plus points we had a great time playing billiards and darts!

But actual serve was soup without garlic bread and brownie without ice cream. What you see is not what you get. False advertising was used here.

Next, mind you to check that service charge and GST are applied on the complimentary soup and dessert. Manager Rajiv explained that the food needed to be brought to the table and that was service rendered. But all other restaurants that I patronized don‚Äôt charge service charge and GST for 50% off Hi-tea or 1-1 deals. Good job to all these restaurants.

The poster indicated $8++ on the complimentary items. Hence, it was consistent with their billing calculations.

Next round when I was at NTUAC, the $8++ on the soup and dessert were strike off.

Last I was there, no more such poster displayed.

Just note that so far only Pen&Inc and Cali restaurants make such practices.

Recently, manager Rajiv had poor customer service attitudes. He could make your pleasant dining experience a shock when billing came. I used two birthday vouchers and had a less than $1 balance on my first order. Then I ordered a beverage and I was issued two receipts for one seating. I had to ask for the first receipt after I was given the second receipt paid for cappuccino. Usually, one seating one bill and a final bill made with whatever balance you have to offset. Rajiv was happy not to amend the first bill and not transfer the balance to the second bill. He was adamant not to do anything and claimed that I asked for billing when I gave the waiter the vouchers.

Finally, the lesson learnt is best don‚Äôt patronise Pen&Inc and Cali so you don‚Äôt have the bad experience after a meal."

Great ambience, professional and friendly service crew, overall a fantastic respite within NTU. However, the food items were hit-or-miss. The salmon was fantastic, but the steak was... let‚Äôs just say, even a hawker stall could deliver better. Fries were tasty...pork fajita was alright, nothing really remarkable...

I‚Äôd give it a positive review only because on both occasions I patronised, I hadn‚Äôt paid the full price: first time was with an eatigo 50% discount, the next was for their $14 set lunch. Without these discounts, I‚Äôd feel disappointingly shortchanged, given the quality of the food - certainly does not command the √† la carte prices, in my opinion.

It has the potential to become a five-star establishment, as long as the consistency of the food quality improves. Everything else (service, ambience) is already in place for an excellent dining experience."

I ordered the beef cheeks, pork loin fajita, wagyu burger and lava cake.

The Wagyu burger was disappointing. It cost a whopping 18 dollars! However, the patty was really bland. There was no seasoning at all. I had to add my own pepper and salt to the patty to make it tasty. The onions were raw and not grilled. However, I have to say that the fries were good! ($18)

Next, the beef cheeks were soft and tender to the bone. Sauce was decent and mash potato is creamy! However, there's not enough sauce to pair with the mash potato as it was paired with the beef cheeks. (Preferred the fries). They could have been more generous with the salad portion. Overall a bit too pricey for this dish. ($22)

Lastly, the pork loin fajita was surprisingly good!! Pork was cooked and seasoned well! It was paired with onions which was good as well! The combination with the wrap and the pork was really delicious. It even came with a side of sour cream and guacamole! Overall a really really good dish that I recommend :)) It was the cheapest out of the 3 main dish. ($16)

When dessert came, I was pleasantly surprised on the presentation of the dish. The lava cake came off a bit sweet but paired really well with the vanilla ice cream. (Although they probably used a cheap ice cream brand) A great way to end the meal :) ($6)

Overall, dish place is a must try if you have the money as it comes off a little pricey. Would recommend if you are finding a place to splurge. Till we meet again, au revoir!"

Price is bit higher side. Many variety to choose from. Vegetable soup was nice but they can have something which can keep it hot for some time. Pizza was good but vegetables on pizza were not baked properly and we're raw. Crust was almost like biscuit my son sais this.

The Omakase lunch set at Mother Earth (see attached for menu) caught my attention, so I went to try it with the family over the weekend. It was surprisingly pretty good!   So their vegetarian food is not just Chinese, but they have Japanese and even Thai vegetarian dishes as well.  The restaurant is very comfortable and spacious, and they also have a shelving rack near the cashier counter selling healthy snacks and tidbits.   My kids ordered the hawaiian pizza and didn't even knew it was vegetarian!  Overall a nice experience and good place to bring family and friends for a meal.  Highly recommended."

Highly recommend the Creamy Abalone Mushroom (made using oat milk for the vegan option), Multigrains Cereal Tofu, Hotplate Black Pepper Chicken Cutlet Rice, and Hotplate Assam Fish Rice. A bit out of the way (8min walk from Joo Koon MRT) but definitely worth visiting when you're in the West.

Customers comes in and out, worth the try, hopefully next visit the place will be neater.
The menu wording too small, wondering why save space,  first time see so small wording for restaurant. Will be pain for elderly to see the wording.

Most disappointing and what led me to write the review was the sesame sauce mushroom. $9.20 Gave like one/two big piece and five/four small piece. Small packet of sauce. Shredded veg. The sauce was so miserable. I ate most of the dish without the sauce."

Amazing Chinese vege food!! Our favorites were the salted egg monkey head mushroom(I don't even like salted egg but loved the butteriness of this), chilli crab mantous (mantous were super crisp), and curry omelette with white rice (altho it tasted like a basic omelette, so quite ex for that). The thai milk tea was too milky, don't recommend. $44 for this, not bad, will come again when nearby"

If I could give a rating lower than zero, I‚Äôd give it -100. What kind of logic is this‚Äîcalling it a restaurant but making it self-service?

And to top it off, they still had the nerve to add a 20% surcharge for CNY Eve. Understand that is CNY charges but come on such services trash.

Worst experience ever, Honestly, should I even pay that when everything is self-service?

There was a moment when all of our dishes had been cleared, but the new ones hadn‚Äôt arrived yet. When they finally brought the new dishes, they just stood there holding them, waiting for us to clear the space ourselves?

Even if it‚Äôs self-service, they could‚Äôve informed us about it beforehand, not after the dishes arrive, when we have to walk over and ask. It‚Äôs basic customer service to let your guests know in advance, and that‚Äôs something any restaurant or service crew should do.

Don‚Äôt use excuses like ‚Äútoo many people‚Äù or ‚Äúlack of staff‚Äù ‚Äì that‚Äôs not the customer‚Äôs issue, it‚Äôs the restaurant‚Äôs. Don‚Äôt shift your problems onto the customers.

The laksa was so flavorful and satisfying, and my daughter was ecstatic, saying her pasta was even better than the one at our resort. The view was simply breathtaking; it was such a treat to watch flocks of birds soaring just outside our window. We were also lucky enough to unexpectedly spot some macaws near the washrooms and emergency exit. If we hadn't been rushing to catch the 12:30 PM ""Wings around the World"" show, we would have happily spent the afternoon relaxing with iced drinks and enjoying the incredible food and atmosphere."

From the moment we stepped in, we felt a sense of warmth and elegance that set the stage for a memorable meal.

It's clear that Crimson's team puts immense care into creating an exceptional experience. The service was simply impeccable, with every interaction feeling genuine and attentive. In particular, Jessica's service stood out. She was incredibly helpful and made sure we felt completely at ease, adding a personal touch that elevated our dining experience.

As for the food, each dish was a delightful exploration of flavors. We started with the truffle fries, which were perfectly crisp and wonderfully aromatic ‚Äì a truly satisfying beginning. The lamb shank was a masterpiece; the meat was so tender it practically melted in our mouths, a testament to the chef's skill. The King Prawn Aglio Olio pasta was another hit, with perfectly cooked prawns and a lovely balance of garlic and olive oil. The King Prawn Laksa was a revelation, bursting with authentic, rich flavors that left us wanting more.

For dessert, the red wine poached pear was a sweet and sophisticated finish, a beautiful blend of texture and taste. And to accompany our meal, the lemon mint tea was refreshingly light, just the right amount of mint and lemon without being overly sweet ‚Äì a perfect palate cleanser.

Crimson restaurant isn't just a place to eat; it's a place to savor moments. The combination of delicious food, thoughtful service, and a pleasant atmosphere makes it a must-try for anyone looking for a truly special dining experience within Bird Paradise."

We had low expectation for the food, given that crimson restaurant is nested within a tourist attraction. However, we were surprised, the quality exceeded what we had anticipated, and the food turned out to be quite good.

Their window seats offer the best view in the entire bird paradise, creating a unique dining experience with a bird watching backdrop. The staff were very friendly and welcoming even during a busy weekend lunch service. Despite being informed that the restaurant was packed and food will take about 45mins to prepare, our order was served in just 15mins. Our kid enjoy the kids meal that came with a cup of juice and an ice cream.

As expected for a restaurant within a tourist spot, the prices are on the higher side. However, posb credit cards may enjoy a 10% discount, while those with cooperate passes can get a 20% discount to offset gst and service charge.

We will definitely head up the lift to level 2, at the entrance of Crimson wetland, the next time we visit bird paradise."

I thought there would be more dishes included. The set meal for 2 is $45 but only includes fries, 4 skewers, and 6 pieces of meat. The most underwhelming part is that there is not much served even though it costs $45 (first picture).

The third picture (the one with the wrap) tasted good, as there are many amazing types of sauces available.

Overall, I think it is an interesting experience to try and the staff are friendly. However, I still feel that the pricing is on the higher side, perhaps because they take more time to prepare the food and do not serve many customers.

The rest of the main dishes are priced quite fairly in my opinion, but their drinks are on the higher side. For example, mineral water costs $3.80.

Total damage for 2 pax: $98"

Rarely do I do review with such a long write up, but I had to do so for such blatant cheating case especially here in Singapore.

TL;DR: We ordered a 6-person set for 8 people; the waiter upsold us to a 12-person portion without clear consent, adding overpriced items and resulting in a $500+ bill. Deceptive practices like this will only drive customers away.

I recently dined at this establishment with a group of eight, and the experience was nothing short of appalling. We selected the 6-person set meal priced at $170, as advertised on their menu. The waiter acknowledged our choice and suggested that it might not suffice for our group, offering to make some adjustments.

To our shock, we were billed for a 12-person portion‚Äîdouble what we intended‚Äîwithout any clear communication or consent. The additional ""recommendations"" he provided were minimal in quantity but exorbitantly priced, culminating in a staggering bill exceeding $500.

This felt like a blatant bait-and-switch tactic, exploiting our trust and lack of detailed menu knowledge. Such deceptive practices are unacceptable and leave a sour taste, overshadowing any culinary merits the restaurant might possess.

To the restaurant management: Cheating your customers is not a sustainable business strategy. Such unethical behavior may yield short-term gains but will ultimately erode trust and drive patrons away. Upholding transparency and integrity is not just good ethics‚Äîit's essential for long-term success.

I urge potential patrons to exercise extreme caution. Ensure every detail of your order is explicitly confirmed, and scrutinize your bill meticulously. Dining out should be an enjoyable experience, not a lesson in vigilance against unscrupulous upselling."

The service was very slow, only 2 persons serving at noon. Other ladies staff come in after 1+pm.
They served the hummus followed by 1 drinks..until 1+pm, the kebab set and 2nd drink was served.
The hummus was plain compared to those that I usually ate, all kebab meats were tasteless too. Only come with one sauce.
Some chicken and biscuits were burned..
The dessert,  kunafa also waited very long. And it taste and smell very oily.
A bird flew over our table and food, despite we were sitting deep inside the aircon place.
( they forgot to close the main door) as we almost finished eating 80%, we decided stop eating the ""bird flew over foods"".

Ordered 1 set for my breakfast, and I'm hooked, wonton is meaty and well marinated with a good size diameter to boot, mostly we get wonton with more skin then meat filling, but this is the real deal, it comes with a bit of prawn meat and chives incorporated into it.

The noodle is springy and doesn't bloat up when you order it as takeaway.

As such my default order will be a plate of wonton noodle + a bowl of wonton soup, muahahaha, eat till my heart's content.

Recently we also tried their port rib version, it is soft and well marinated also, do give it a go also, either ask them to add on top of your wonton noodle order or just order pork rib ver itself."

Tried a new dish today: the fried fish with taro claypot. The fish was well-coated and fried to a crisp golden finish, and the thick slices of taro complemented it nicely, offering a satisfying contrast in texture.

However, the gravy was overly starchy, likely due to the use of too much flour. A taro-based gravy might have enhanced the dish further with more depth and creaminess. Additionally, the green chives used were past their prime, resulting in a fibrous texture that made them unpleasantly tough to chew."

I haven‚Äôt been here for years, this time and was shocked by the experience.

Right after I sat down, the staff brought 2 small side dishes without saying a word. I asked if the side dishes are free? They no reply. One was achar, the other I couldn‚Äôt even know and it tasted bad. We only had a few bites.

Then I was only given a set meal menu, even though I just wanted some fried rice, bee hoon, and fried chicken. We were seat next to the waiter, and we kept asking each other why there was no bee hoon on the menu. The waiter was right beside us but didn‚Äôt react at all it made me feel like I had walked into the wrong place.

I even saw there was a Citibank ‚ÄúBuy 1 Free 1‚Äù promotion for bee hoon, so I asked the waiter why my menu don‚Äôt have bee foon. Then they give me normal menu.

I clearly said I wanted a small portion Bee foon, fried rice and , fried chicken. but they served a large one. And worse, two order checklist when I only ordered one. When I asked again, they told me the side dishes actually cost money!

What kind of attitude is this? Just because I‚Äôm a younger customer in my 20s, they force items and upsell without asking.

In the end 3 dishes we order cost 62.68. Some more I pay via Citibank without promotion.

However, on our recent visit, the quality has noticeably dropped. The quality of other previously notable side dishes are quite different from our previous experiences, e.g. the prawn roll, the chicken wings. But the worst part was the prawn fritter. It is abject misery coalesced in 4 tiny pieces. I understand that inflation is rampant nowadays but those pieces were way too small for their price point."

But honestly, the pork is dry in the beehoon i ate.

Instead, of seeing customer and quickly serve the cashier keep counting cash and the other staff also did not really help until i go there and waited to go in before serving.

Another customer, stand behind and could not wait and left.

Food quality and portion have been pretty inconsistent.

2 stars overall for the portion size.

Portion for Broccoli is really poor for 13.80. I got 10 stalks. It's 1.38 per stalk. I'm not comparing to home-cooked food. But come on.

The rest are decent. It's not like what it used to be. I hope they will improve after reading this.

Will be back to try again."

Easy to find table if you arrive at a not-so-busy time. Food took an OK time to arrive. The meat was juicy and tender. Bee Hoon broth was really tasty and right texture. Noise level was OK. Price was decent and affordable. So far we had pleasant experience.

However, taste wise it was really a little lacking. The white beehoon was like a sticky gooey version with lots of egg. Came with 2 small prawns and 2 scallop which was honestly quite little at this price point.

The XO fried rice was also just average- quite spicy, nothing really outstanding.

Service was very good and friendly. Ambience was quite warm during a hot afternoon. Overall really quite average food for this price- I will probably not try again."

Thanks to Google, we found it in no time.

The eatery was actually named WHITE RESTAURANT located at a neat and tidy shop lot. We circled round to look for curbside parking, but all occupied. But‚Ä¶as we were turning out to the main road, detected available @basement parking in a new building, whoa‚Ä¶convenient.

Ordered their signature dishes The Original White Beehoon (which was actually a braised seafood beehoon), Fried Chicken Wings, the Signature Hae Zhor, Crispy Squid Prawn Cakes and the Passionfruit Sparkling Drinks.

The appetizers were served rather quickly. Grand daughter Sera ogled at the Hae Zhor (we knew that‚Äôs one of her favorite food), so we told her to start eating. She loved it. Pretty good really.

The Fried Chicken Wing was well done crispy but texture still soft. But we felt it lacked flavor.

Wifey and I were a little disappointed with the Crispy Squid Prawn Cake. The four pieces serving was rather small (kind of ‚Äúdeceived‚Äù by the photo). However, it was quite nice.

When the Braised White Beehoon was served, it looked nice and appetizing. Indeed it was. There were several good sized prawns and scallops, with good amounts of chye sim. So the $22 for the Large Portion was reasonable. Little Eve was visually enjoying the Beehoon, she ate a small bowl of it rather quickly. Wifey and I felt that it would be better if crispy pork lards were included‚Ä¶well, for healthy eatingü§£ü§£ü§£

With all the servers so friendly, helpful and accommodating to little children, it was a good dining experience there.üëç"

The chicken was served uncut and without scoop. Asked a staff to cut it up who told me to tear myself with spoon. Yet I could see one staff cut it for another customer. Quite double standard of service. Achar and wet tissue chargeable. Got 10% festive charge!"

The food was good and the highlight for me would be the white bee hoon, the meat and seafood roll and the tofu. Ribs was also good.

While the steam fish was fresh and expertly steamed, and the vegetable dish was well-cooked and delicious with fried shrimp, the signature White Bee Hoon unfortunately didn't meet our expectations. The standard of this dish seems to have dropped compared to our previous experiences.

However, the service more than made up for it! The staff were fast, efficient, and attentive, ensuring our meal was served promptly and with a smile.

Overall, a solid dining experience, but hoping to see the White Bee Hoon return to its former glory!"

Had a very nice white beehoon, homemade tofu!
However, pretty Disappointed with the tenderness of the dong bo rou, it was real hard and from the photo on top left is the lean part that support to remove before serving.

Overall experience was really ok, until the part where the meat is served. I'm pretty disappointed.

To be fair, we gave honest feedback to the counter staff ‚Äî the pancake was floury, the pork was mediocre, and the beef was overly sweet (which we actually sent back, so they were clearly aware). In hindsight, getting the bundle wasn‚Äôt worth it considering how underwhelming the pork was ‚Äî dry and bland. Thankfully, we skipped the stew bundle.

Haha, I‚Äôm definitely not ‚Äúrevengeful,‚Äù nor am I seeking an ‚Äúapology‚Äù ‚Äî not sure where the owner got that idea. I‚Äôm simply sharing an honest take on what was, unfortunately, a disappointing F&B experience. Maybe the one who needs to ‚Äúgo learn cooking‚Äù is‚Ä¶ them?

And judging by the owner‚Äôs past (and present) dramatic responses to other reviews, it‚Äôs clear how feedback is handled ‚Äî don‚Äôt bother wasting your time. As for those 4.7 stars on Google? Feels like a scam.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Update: Please see the owner‚Äôs rather defensive response‚ÄîI‚Äôll let others decide whether that‚Äôs an appropriate way to handle customer feedback.

Just to clarify, our concern was never about the price. We‚Äôre more than willing to pay $72.90 for two if the food quality justifies it. Unfortunately, in this case, it didn‚Äôt.

We opted not to go for the bundled BBQ meat + stew and rice set because, after tasting the food, we didn‚Äôt feel inclined to order more. (For the record, the bundle was only $1.10 more‚Äîso saving money was never the intention.)

As for the beef, it was overly sweet‚Äîalmost syrupy‚Äîand we couldn‚Äôt take more than a bite. We did appreciate being allowed to switch to BBQ pork, but even that didn‚Äôt make up for the overall experience.

The pancake was also underwhelming: visible from the pic ‚Äîjust a few visible strands of spring onions and carrots, and small bits of squid and shrimp.

At the end of the day, food is subjective. But when customers take the time to give feedback, it should be met with professionalism‚Äînot personal attacks.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Surprised by the 4.7-star rating on Google‚Äîunfortunately, the food didn‚Äôt live up to the ratings. The pricing felt steep considering the overall quality.

Food quality:
‚Ä¢BBQ Pork Belly: Overcooked, dry, and lacking in flavor. Felt like something easily made at home. At $18.90 per portion (two strips of belly), it‚Äôs hard to justify the cost.

‚Ä¢BBQ Beef: Heavily marinated to the point of being overly sweet and salty. Priced at $29.90 per portion.

‚Ä¢Seafood Pancake: Very little seafood and mostly batter. At $17.90++, it was underwhelming and not worth the price.

Overall, the value for money just isn‚Äôt there."

I didnt really fall in love with thr decor of the restaurant because I feel it is too heavily decorated with kpop stars photos everywhere.  If anything it is overwhelming. I wish they have the tv to play kpop mtv.

Glad the restaurant opens for lunch and we had a great army stew there. The mando was nice but must eat whilst hot or else turn hard after it is cold. Bubble tea not nice. In suburban area, this is considered one of the better korean food.

Hallasan latte (almond coffee) came with a Mt Jeju shaped foam on top - interesting, I liked it but my partner didn't, try for yourself! Best of all was the table service. Best restaurant service we've had in a long time! Snow was extremely attentive, proactively checking on our stew temperature, strength of the tea, and many other little details. We'll definitely be back to try other menu items, but mostly impressed by the great service!

Both the service and the food ‚Äî buffet spread and mains ‚Äî need serious review and improvement.
Service was lacking initiative. No greetings upon arrival, and we were the ones repeatedly approaching staff for assistance. The team should be proactive and attentive to guests‚Äô needs, especially since the place wasn‚Äôt even busy at the time.

The buffet spread should maintain top quality at all times, yet the pasta and pizza were already drying out. The bread was hard, and surprisingly, no butter was provided. There was no egg live station despite the ad saying otherwise.

As for the mains ‚Äî they were too bland to enjoy, and we barely finished them."

Servers were generally helpful but they can be more proactive, for example serving water or at least provide glasses so we can help ourselves. We had to sit outdoors for a while until an indoor table became available. It was very warm outside but the servers did not bother to serve water until we asked.

The brunch menu primarily consists of deep fried food. Buffet line consists of lukewarm pizza and sausages mainly - not sure if it was cooked properly. It is quite overpriced in my opinion. We ordered the prawn tempura and it came undercooked.

The place would be nicer in the evening when the weather is cooler. There was a live band but it was too hot to sit outdoors.

The restaurant needs to seriously relook the menu and train the kitchen on cooking food thoroughly,"

The fish batter was soft and soggy.

The new deco also looked somewhat cheap. The old deco was more classic and the lounge chairs were more comfortable. Service was bad, one of our dish was served 20 mins apart from the other dishes. How do they expect people to dine together?

We used to patronize this place quite often. Its really sad to see what Youngs has become. Not sure if they have changed the manager or owner, but I certainly cannot recommend this place anymore. AVOID at all cost..."

Came for Sunday brunch again but they have switched their Sunday menu to only buffet. Although it looks good on the menu but the quality of food was bad. The sandwiches really taste like sand. The bread was hard and dry. The pizza wasn't fresh at all. The only ""fresh thing"" was the basket of fried food that they offered with the buffet. No issues with buffets but the quality is not worth your calories. It is really quite bad. Wish they revert to a normal brunch menu.

Came here on a sunday for brunch and the food is really good here. Don't know what the bad reviews about. We ordered the steak fries, lasagne and mushroom omelette,  they were all great. Super tasty!

We ordered the breakfast platter with sausage and bacon etc. Supposedly to be served with smoked salmon but they run out of it and served as with 3 slices of turkey ham. The platter does not require any culinary skills but cost $32 so I personally dont think it is value for money. Skip this.

Club sandwich - mediocre, salty. 7-11 quick sandwich bite might be tastier.

Chessy beef pancake - the better of all but neverthless salty as well. Basically you could not feel the chef's sincerity in these 3 dishes. My main gripe is probably the price doesnt justify the taste.

The best among the dishes would be the free oysters due to the promotion. It is fresh and since it doesnt need cooking, I guess thats why it tastes good. We wanted to order more but it is not available on the menu. Total damage for 3 pax: $80plus

Coffee was normal too.

I never post reviews but this place's shady tactics need to be brought to attention. Definitely check out the other 1 star reviews from people who experienced the same thing as us.

What this place advertises and what they deliver differ greatly - the classic bait and switch tactic.

Been here twice before with my partner; merely to satisfy our cravings for middle eastern food without having to leave the comforts of the heartlands. Both times, we were never impressed with what we were served but felt that the subpar service and food would be expected of an ""under the block"" kopitiam (place doesnt deserve the title 'restaurant'), albeit it was on the  extremely overpriced side.

The real shocker was when we came with family recently. We had yet to settle down, fully scrutinise the menu, and come to a proper decision when the waiter came and conversed with one of us on the pretense of suggesting the best items to order that would accomodate our group. Having half of the group as small eaters, it was decided that the 6pax menu would suffice, with an addition of ordering 2 salads and 2 extra servings of bread.

The kicker was, the waiter did not clarify with us or inform us that he would be serving TWO!! of the 6 pax. What's worse, he added on other sides that we had not explicitly ordered. We naively thought the items served were part of the 6 pax meal, the horrible realisation that we had been cheated only came when it was time to pay.

From the above description, it would seem that it was alot of food, but it was the exact opposite! Servings were barely sufficient for what we were charged.

Tried confronting before paying but he merely waived off $24 from the $524 bill. What a joke.

Even their service was extremely below expectations. Served the dishes without informing us what the items were, no initiative to provide sufficient cutlery for dessert, cleared the plates without clarifying if we were done with it yet. Everything was an utter dissapointment.

The whole ordeal left a bad taste in everyone's mouth. Definitely won't be coming back."

Excellent prompt service, tasty food and it came across as really authentic and seems the part. Arabic music and lively decor added to the whole Middle Eastern vibes.

Overall bill was $25 for lunch, a tad expensive for Yishun but it is to be expected for this setting and piping hot freshly prepared food straight from the oven.

The food served was exquisitely Turkish. üáπüá∑
Great taste!

There was a small misunderstanding when we were asking about the foods that are really popular in the store n recommended to try for first timer.

Walking spaces can be quite tight with the huge tables and chairs within the restaurant, however the chairs are pretty comfortable in my own opinion. Quite ImPressed with the layout and decoration within the restaurant.

I came with a group of nine and was shocked to be charged over $500 after unknowingly being given a 12-person platter instead of the 6-person one we agreed on but yet what they given us wasnt even amounted to a 12 person portion. What a joke. Extras were added without our consent, and the portions were small, with poor taste of food compared to other similar cuisine restaurants  and the food looked nothing like the menu photos. Some were being shown as a big platter, ended up being really small. Service was poor too , we had to ask repeatedly for basic things, and our teapots were taken while still in use. Overall, a 1/10 experience. They also seem to be posting fake positive reviews, impersonating people which is crazy desperate .."

I‚Äôd like to commend the excellent service I experienced at your restaurant, particularly from the floor manager on duty.

Firstly, there were two young boys (around 4‚Äì5 years old) running along the long bench at the table beside mine. I noticed the manager observing the situation from a distance. She seemed genuinely concerned about the boys' safety and was also mindful that their behavior might disturb other diners ‚Äî including my family, seated two tables away. She approached the boys‚Äô mother with great professionalism and politeness to address the issue. I truly appreciated her thoughtfulness and tact.

Secondly, when it came time to settle the bill, she asked me to check it before payment. I didn‚Äôt do so carefully and ended up paying for another table's bill by mistake. Although it was entirely my oversight, she handled the situation swiftly and efficiently, clearly explaining the refund process and rectifying the error without any hassle.

These two incidents may seem simple, but in my experience, such attentiveness and professionalism are rare ‚Äî even in more upscale establishments. Kudos to the restaurant‚Äôs management for training her so well. She truly sets a high standard for customer service."

The buffet spread was great with variety of food choices from Indian, Malay and Western.. even have the Sup Tulang merah..

Live station outside served satay, corn, sausage & bbq winglet..

Seafood such as mussels, mini lobsters, chilli crab, black pepper prawns were delicious.. there are plastic gloves provided too, so happy for that..

Drinks are free flow and have many choices! Yayy.. they also have live band playing not so loudly which is pleasant for the environment..

Service was good, the plates were cleared almost immediately after we finished eating.. Good job..

It is a halal restaurant and is very big.  It is mostly indoor seating with some tables al fresco but still sheltered, so no worries about inclement weather even if seated outside.

The variety of dishes served was amazing.  The seafood dishes were fresh and I loved the flavours. Among the seafood dishes, there were prawns (of good size), crabs, fish, mussels, clams etc.  If you are looking for more meat, there‚Äôs chicken cooked in a few styles, rendang beef, satay, chicken and mutton with a delicious satay sauce to go with.  There is also a salad corner for you to assemble your little simple salad.  I love the dessert corner, it offers a good variety of western and local desserts to choose from.  There were kueh kuehs, cakes, bread/mango puddings, pulut hitam, ice cream, churros etc all not overly sweet, which is great as we are more health conscious these days.

The food was continually replenished in a timely manner though there was a huge dinner crowd, there wasn‚Äôt anything that completely ran out that I have to give it a miss. Satay was very popular among the diners and it ran out fast but eventually we also got to try it and there were sufficient for everyone.

Though there were many diners, everyone queued in an orderly manner at the buffet line.

The wait staff is also very polite, friendly and efficient and I really do appreciate the good service.

There was also live music too on the night that I was there.

Overall it was a lovely dining experience and our family enjoyed the company and the amazing variety of food (everyone in the group could find something they like) üòç

Parking is also easy as there are many parking lots (unless there are special functions taking place).

I love the buffet (so did my family) and I would come back again for family gatherings in future.

Update:

Went back again on a Saturday night for the buffet due to the favourable experience the last time on a weekday.  The restaurant was very crowded and I think it was full house.  However, this time round, the experience wasn‚Äôt as great, so I have moderated the rating based on both visits.

The queue for drinks was very very long and people were filling a few cups each and queueing for their relatives and friends, such that when I thought I was just behind a few more people, they were suddenly joined by a whole group of others and each one filling a few cups - very irritating. The drinks queue actually reached the door leading to the outdoor satay station, until they had to designate a staff to do the filling of drinks for the diners.  As we were seated near to the drinks machine, there was so much spillage on the floor that we were practically stepping on sticky liquid every time we left the table to get more food.  The queue for food was super long too and sometimes one of the dishes run out but we still have to move along the buffet line in order not to hold back the rest of the diners, but when the dish was replenished later and we only wanted to get hold of some of that dish, we will need to re-queue because some of the diners actually don‚Äôt allow us to go straight to the dish that we missed.  Satay station had no plates or bowls, and people were just grabbing bunches of satay and trying to put satay sauce on them initially, until someone feedback to the staff, only then were some bowls and dishes placed there.  Very different experience since the first time we were here.  Probably won‚Äôt be back for a while."

The so-called ‚Äúinternational buffet‚Äù was very underwhelming‚Äîlimited food selection that didn‚Äôt live up to its name. Yet, the price was $1xx++ per pax, the same as premium buffets in town. It feels like they inflated the price just to offer a 1-for-1 promo, making it seem like a deal when it‚Äôs actually not worth it.

Service was also a letdown‚Äîespecially the Indian lady at the reception, who was cold and unfriendly. When I casually asked about any birthday promotions, she simply replied, ‚ÄúNo, Mdm,‚Äù with no warmth or effort to provide a better customer experience. In contrast, town restaurants with similar pricing often offer at least a small birthday treat or a polite response.

LOVE especially the satay!. The cucumber and onions we so fresh. The desserts were lovely and there was a live band and it was such a pleasant night with that atmosphere."

I have been here half year ago. Food finished fast when the crowd got big and replenishment of more food was slow but today the speed in replenishing food  & topping up drink is fast, thumbs-up! Just got to know Seniors have got further discounts during the promo period :). There is a free shuttle bus at Yishun MRT exit B waiting area to the venue.  Do review the shuttle bus' departure timing. In the afternoon, there is a gap of one bus leaving at 1355pm & then have to wait till 1525pm for the next bus."

Need to make reservations cause I think its quite full. The Q for food is quite long. Maybe because of the promotion 1 for 1. Or else its quite pricey.
The sate stall is very slow and at 7pm the sate is still not ready yet. I wish you provide ice cream for dessert.
There is a place for prayer n ablution üëçüëç but only prayer mat provided but still ok. Better than none. Food is nice n tasty even tho I did not manage to taste all. Im already overloaded. Had a hard time sleeping that night and feel very thirsty before sleep.ü§≠"

To my dismay, they behaved very selfishly‚Äîtaking two large plates of prawns each without consideration for others, completely emptying the pot. It was like they hadn‚Äôt eaten in months.

What‚Äôs worse, at the end of the meal, they left a large plate of prawns untouched, and Royal Palm didn‚Äôt even charge them for the food wastage. This was really disappointing.

Royal Palm, if you have such a large group booking the space in the future, please ensure other guests don‚Äôt suffer due to inefficient food replenishment or the thoughtless behavior of some diners who consume without regard for others.This will be my first and the last time visiting Royal Palm"

The food is acceptable, but the service is lousy. Not all staff are professional. When we asked for clean plates, the staff informed us to use the bowl‚ÄîOMG, using the bowl to get our dishes. The drinks were not filled, and when asked, the staff asked us to go outside to fill our cups. To enter, we needed to queue, which took us half an hour. Getting the food took us 45 minutes to get the food, to making payment also took us nearly 45 minutes in the queue. It's not worth my paying $500+ for this type of service. If you need the crowd for your business, you need to have enough staff on the floor and a professional one. This will be my first and last dinner in this place."

The food is freshly cooked and the place has an old school charm.

The relaxing place feels more like a chalet so you need to manage your expectation. The restaurant overlooks a cooling swimming pool which gives a holiday vibe. üòé

However, the place is very secluded and the parking can be a bit puzzling when they differentiate the members from the guests of the Country Club. As an old place, this is very well-maintained.

What is surprising is that there is an NTUC at a makeshift corner near to the carpark."

The chilli crab is slightly on the sweeter side and the sauce isn't as thick. The mussels aren't fresh. We went in during lunch it was 60 dollars ish for 2 people? To be honest it's not that cheap to travel all the way for that. There's plenty of other buffets with similar value might have better selection too. Teh tarik was a miss for me. Machine teh tarik isn't always the best.. Hire a staff to do hot drinks I'm sure it would have a better appeal to others. How hard is it to make hot drinks?exactly. Desserts are pretty standard. Could use a bit more attention to the selection. Remove what's not popular add what's popular. The menu is pretty standard it's the same year after year.

As delicious as you would find in a high class restaurant. Really a gem. We had their ribeye steak that was 300g, a big chunk was served and the beef wagyu stew was simply melt in the mouth with a lot of flavour. The sides were pretty good as well and very value for money. Usually you would find the sides at 10-15 in restaurants but here they serve it at 4. Had their margarita as well which was wonderful. It also has an al fresco area that‚Äôs pet-friendly. I dare say it‚Äôs a hidden gem."

2) 2* Truffle Rosti - 1/10. Rosti burned!! Mushroom so dry....
3) Pull Pork Rosti - 1/10. Rosti burned!! The pork sauce taste horrible, like those canned sardine tomato sauce
4) Katsu Chicken Burger - 2/10. Tasteless and dry.. Macspicy taste better than it.

The restaurant itself is spacious and cozy, with simple yet inviting d√©cor that creates a warm and visually pleasant atmosphere. It‚Äôs the perfect place to unwind and indulge in great food.

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the food ‚Äì it‚Äôs nothing short of amazing. We started with the Mussel Mariniere, and it was an absolute delight. Each mussel was incredibly fresh, tasting as if it was just fished out of the sea. The broth was light yet bursting with flavor, making it a perfect pairing with the soft, fresh bread on the side. It was a lovely and flavorful introduction to the meal.

The Grilled Angus Ribeye is another showstopper. We ordered it medium-well, and it was cooked to perfection. This is hands down one of the best steaks we've had in Singapore. The meat was juicy, tender, and every bite was a burst of natural steak flavor that had been perfectly locked in. The black pepper sauce was a nice touch, adding an extra layer of depth, though the steak itself was so well-cooked that we personally enjoyed it without the sauce. Truly a highlight of the meal!

Then there‚Äôs the Ang Moh Laksa Burger ‚Äì an unexpected surprise and a must-try! This fusion creation marries the bold flavors of East and West in the most delicious way. The perfect balance of spice and indulgence, it‚Äôs something you have to experience for yourself.

Service here is fast and attentive, and the prices are more than reasonable for the generous portions and top-quality dishes. The staff is friendly and welcoming, making the entire experience feel special and effortless.

I‚Äôll definitely be coming back to Young Bar and Restaurant to try more dishes from their menu. If you're in the area, don't miss out ‚Äì this place is a culinary treasure!"

Just wish that they served it hot cause it was at room temperature when served, probably not freshly fried, so it did become soggier after a while.

There were flies everywhere and it was annoying. Bird shit went into one of our drinks..

Had to queue for 20mins to get the food.. and most of the food were not replaced or refilled quick enough.  So most of the time I'm spending waiting or queuing.

Service was extremely slow and looked like they were understaffed. One of the staff I requested to clear the table only cleared half the plates and never came back.

The food was below average and it is not worth to dine here. Some of the seafood was not fresh.

Making payment was horrendous. Another queue for 30min. Spend your money elsewhere.

The location is convenient to get to with free shuttle service from Yishun MRT to the Royal Palms and vice-versa (every 15 minutes, schedule can be found at the Royal Palms official website).

There is an on-going promotion (went on the 10th of Sept 2022, Sat) for 1-for-1 so we gathered our loved ones for a wonderful dinner after work!

I really like the ambient; spacious (there's room to walk around) and well-lit, the dishes are placed neatly like any other buffet setting. The service staff were all friendly and approachable. They will walk around and assist to clear away your plates so you can go ahead and grab yourself some more morsels or hefty portion of what's available on the menu.

For that particular evening I helped myself to a generous plate of White Rice, Beef Rendang, Teriyaki Chicken Cutlet and Mixed Baby Kailan. Beef Rendang was tender and it's Rendang you can never go wrong it was so-good! Teriyaki Chicken Cutlet was on the slightly sweet and savoury side really complement with the crunchy Mixed Baby Kailan veggie dish (there's baby corn, mushrooms, but prominently Kailan). This was definitely filling.

Next round I grabbed two Sweet Potatoes, BBQ Wings (I think?), two Mantous, three Peppery Sausages and Kambing Golek (Skewered Lamb, I think) douses generously in Black Pepper Sauce Chicken Tikka and Flatbread, let's just say they were wiped cleaned despite the first plate of rice and side dishes made me kind of full.

I also had traditional Malay kuehs but I am bad at Malay kueh names so... there's kueh lapis like rainbow color, brown chewy kueh in shave coconut? There are cakes, pastries, churros and Satays (mutton and chicken) as well.

Fruits, salad, ice-creams you name it you'll definitely be spoiled for choice.

Dinner was also accompanied by acoustic performances a mix of Malay and English songs though am not sure if the singer is a staff, on contract or a dinner guest? But on that night it was a very talented Malay lady who sang. At the end of the evening the staff came over and asked how was our dinner and we had a small wonderful chat, color me impressed and these small gestures really makes me want to visit another time.

Oh, we also got to meet Chef Bob, friendly guy! Definitely give the Royal Palms @ OCC a go if you haven't."

The dinner set has tons of options for non-vegetarian folks but a limited option for vegetarian, however staff managed to get us two curries (Daal makhani, Palak paneer and some nice rice) the food was super duper authentic (probably the best North Indian daal makhani I had). Everyone was happy and staff was very much welcoming, all in all best place. They also gave us complement bowling vouchers which we enjoyed nicely.

We took table near pool side, if you have some kids who need a bit of extra space I suggest to sit out as inside it could become crowded and kids not having space they need. However, be very careful with kids and net the pool as it‚Äôs a bit risky.

Place closes 10 pm they also had live band :)"

We had to queue for food which was served by servers who were in charge of a few dishes (refer to photos). I feel like they could have done a better job at organising this or they could have done as other buffets have done - let customers order the dishes they wanted and have that served to them.

We also had to sit outside and that was a little awkward. Nevertheless food tasted good :)"

The so-called ‚Äúinternational buffet‚Äù was very underwhelming‚Äîlimited food selection that didn‚Äôt live up to its name. Yet, the price was $1xx++ per pax, the same as premium buffets in town.

The food spread and quality was good and similar to that of Landmark and it's almost full house despite a weekday.

The curry fish head, chilli crabs, sambal clams, pepper prawns, and beef rendang are some of the ""must try"". But there was no satay, probably only weekends they have that.

Foods were frequently replenished and staff were friendly and polite, and also efficient in clearing the used plates and utensils.

So little variety of food on display felt like I was just eating merely Nasi Padang. Seafood was meh, and why is there even fish head in a buffet?
Queue to take food was horrendous and felt like I was in a school canteen queuing up for food. The layout is bad and super cramped. Don‚Äôt even get me started on the outdoor ‚Äòroast‚Äô live station. The roast lamb was so so so dry almost chewed my teeth out. Salad at the salad bar looks so withered and sad.
Food was subpar only the beef rendang and fish coconut was nice. The service was worst, staff did not walk around to clear empty plates on our tables ( we had to stack our plates btw )
Don‚Äôt get your expectations so high, everything is mediocre. Staff on ground did not top up the buffet frequently. Not coming here again, bring your money elsewhere."

While we understood that it was close to closing time, it was quite disappointing to pay the full price and find that basic items like steamed rice were not replenished. Guests were left scraping the bottom of the pot for leftovers, which was not an ideal experience.

Additionally, several dishes were nearly empty, and we had to repeatedly call the staff‚Äôs attention to have them refilled. It would have been more appropriate if the staff had shown initiative in monitoring and topping up the food stations without needing to be prompted.

At the live station, the satay was decent, but we were taken aback by the condition of the kambing golek. The tongs were surrounded by small ants, which raised serious concerns about hygiene and cleanliness. To make matters worse, the chocolate fountain area was messy and splattered, yet no staff members seemed to notice or attend to it.

Furthermore, the flooring‚Äîboth inside and outside‚Äîwas slippery and appeared greasy, making it uncomfortable and even hazardous to walk around. We had to be extra cautious to avoid slipping.

Overall, while we had high hopes for a pleasant celebration, the experience fell short in many areas. Given the quality of service, hygiene, and food replenishment, we feel it was not worth the price. It was truly disappointing, and unfortunately, we will not be returning."

I went for a family dinner, and the restaurant had something for everyone. We ordered fish tacos, chicken fajitas and chicken pasta. For the vegetarians in our group, we got some quesadillas, a burrito bowl, pizza and some wedges.

The staff is friendly and are very accommodating of any special needs or dietary requirements. The place is in a lovely neighborhood near Thomson road.

The only downside here is parking. There is a tiny free car park, and some on-road parking but definitely not enough for a weekend crowd."

Ordered a kappa (tapioca) chicken briyani ($12.90) to go from their menu, (listed as a main) When I got home, all I could see in the dish was the chicken and gravy, with no tapioca and/or rice ( see first pic - this is ALL of it, uneaten). For comparison - look at how the dish is supposed to look like in the 2nd pic (not from their store). See the difference?
Went back to enquire if they forgot to provide the tapioca/rice and was told that this is how they serve it.
When ask to point out where the tapioca was, they said it was 'mashed in' and repeatedly defended the quantity.
I gave up and ordered a rice ($6.90) just so I could eat the meal. They belatedly offered another rice, but only after I had already ordered and paid for one, so it was a pointless gesture.

A disappointing experience overall (I was the first customer and only customer at the time, so they weren't busy) with poor customer service.

So you be the judge - would you pay $12.90 for this?"

The meal started with an adventurous appetizer featuring fish sperm‚Äîdefinitely a unique dish, though not something I could personally enjoy. The snail had a strong fishy aroma that wasn‚Äôt to my taste, but the seaweed was fresh, well-seasoned, and appetizing.

The tempura was a highlight, served piping hot with a light and crispy batter that enhanced the freshness of the ingredients. The sashimi and nigiri were outstanding‚Äîfar superior to what I‚Äôve had elsewhere, with incredibly fresh and flavorful cuts of fish. However, the maki roll was a bit disappointing, as the seaweed had turned soggy, making it feel like it had been prepared too far in advance.

The location might be a little out of the way, but it‚Äôs worth a trip for the fresh produce, cosy environment and warm service by manager Hwee Li, who curated the dinner menu for us.

Loved every dish that was served - you can literally taste the oceans in the refreshing seaweed appetiser, and the best dish of night was the juicy grilled amberjack fish head, which was the special of the day. The sashimi was super fresh, and the lightly battered tempura & fried calamari were delicious as well.

A hidden gem that‚Äôs worth a visit!"

We ordered the larger dinner set, the Omasake sashimi, as well as the tempura, dried fugu and the daikon with cheese. For dessert we had the milk pudding, sesame and strawberry ice-creams. The service was excellent throughout, and there was a surprise birthday cake beautifully designed for our friend. In fact every dish was exquisitely arranged. The ingredients were top quality and refined, even their soba. The ambience is tasteful,  and the quiet location is away from the madding crowds at the malls. Strongly recommended."

Drinks costs a lot and so does the food, thankfully the food was actually good but still pretty pricey. 4 dishes only and I'm paying $90. Toilets condition isn't the best either. It's a very run down building. There were groups inside talking super loudly too. Would I ever come back here again. I would say no, cause I do know of a place with better food and cheaper cost.

Mexican bar food was yummy and quality above expectation of a watering hole. Margaritas were strong and reasonably priced. Fish tacos were good! I might just go down just for the fish tacos.

June 2023: returned again for the fish tacos. Was very good as I remembered. However, they really need to increase the number of chefs as people were waiting for ages for food that never arrived when other people on the same table had received theirs."

The chairs were stained, the table had crumbs, deco is tacky, there was a fly hounding our table relentlessly, the state of the toilet sink was extremely gross and moldy, the server was blur and couldnt take our orders correctly. To top it off, the google name said best mexican restaurant in singapore which is not a good sign. But because i already came all the way here and booked the place, I decided not to walk out.

What really surprised me was the food, it was authentic and fantastic. The chef really takes pride in their food. Chicken wings were well marinated and crispy on the outside, the beef chimichanga was also fantastic with soft, pull apart slow cooked beef and the fish taco was fabulous - smoky, zesty, crispy at the same time.

So yes I would come back again just on the basis of their food. I really want to give this place 5 stars but i cannot until the cleanliness of this place can be improved, please!"

Pleasantly surprised to find a restaurant serving Kerala food hidden in a Mexican Bistro restaurant.
The highlight of this joint is the magical Kerala special the ""Munthiri Kallu"".. fermented Toddy served chilled in a earthenware pot.
We ordered  Kerala Porotta, Beef roast, chicken pakkoda and Munthiri Kallu. Kids tried the Enchilada.
Porotta was was so soft and delicately layered. I can say this is the best Kerala Porotta I have had in Singapore.
Beef roast was was amazing too.. full of flavour, tender and juicy coated with special  spices.

The food is fine. Some are good, some are just ok.
Their Angamaly Pork is one of the best sellers but the port content is so less, just 20-40% is Pork, rest are an Indian variety of potato I guess. They have to change that proportion, else it's not worth the money right now.
Their Mexican dishes are definitely good, you should try their Fish tacos. It sounded weird when I heard of it, but they have a very good version of it which you may not really get anywhere else in SG.
Their other Kerala dishes are just fine, can't compare them with the likes of other Kerala restaurants in SG like Premas, Paradise, Spice Junction, Kayaloram. They should improve their Kerala dishes. E.g the malabar chicken, beef curry, beef roast, these dishes are not where close to what their competitors give in Singapore. I suggest the owners to just try their dishes side by side with their competitors food. Service is good. I find the service staff here much better than the competitors, smiling and welcoming. Could be slow sometimes but usually they are fine.
Their strawberry kallu is ‚ù§Ô∏è
My friends have tried their cocktails and says it's good
I tried their mocktails and lassee. It's wow."

There's no missing flavor in any dish (that's another way of saying every dish is heavily salted). Try the chicken fajitas too. That was probably their best dish (not pictured).

During my recent visit to the restaurant, I was greatly disappointed by the poor value for money. Despite the prices being relatively high ($30 per pax), the overall quality of the ingredients used in the dishes left much to be desired.

Specifically, I ordered the pork rib BBQ with great anticipation, but it turned out to be a major letdown. The meat seemed to have an unpleasant frozen taste, indicating that it might not have been freshly prepared. Moreover, the dish emitted a strong odor, which was off-putting and affected the overall enjoyment of the meal.

In addition to the pork rib BBQ, I also decided to try the cheese nachos, expecting a delightful cheesy treat. Unfortunately, my excitement quickly faded as I realized that the cheese used in the nachos appeared to be processed. This choice of cheese greatly affected the taste and texture of the dish, leaving it lacking the creamy and rich flavor that authentic melted cheese should have offered. Instead, it tasted like a bland and generic cheese slices commonly found in a school‚Äôs canteen morning breakfast set.

Overall, I would not recommend this place to Mexican food enthusiasts / lovers üòêüëéüèª"

Order a couple of beer and potatoes wedges, that comes with the mash potatoes.. clearly can taste that the mash potatoes are coming from cans or some kind of ready packed and just heat it up to serve.

Place is a bit cramped. Indoor is full of echo with large crowd. Worst part, when the music volume start tuned up... it makes dinner a bit on the terrible side.

After we ordered and waiting for our food, 1) a pest technician (with his full gear) came in under the guidance of the waiter, and squirt some of the anti pest liquid at 2 corners of the restaurant. 2) Then the waiter came and spray some deodorant spray ard the restaurant, supposedly to cover the smell of the pest liquid.

The vegetables taste fresh. The lettuce is just romain so nothing too substantial. The rice is a bit oily.
The tofu was good but there wasn‚Äôt much of it added.
You choose a few sides and a main. The base is salad and rice or pasta. I think that‚Äôs how it works‚Ä¶
No credit but they take cash.

If you‚Äôre looking for a healthy option on campus with lots of vegetables, try the Yong Tau Foo in south spine (fine foods)."

Their portion sizes are perfect for me, I can eat a normal cai fan 3 ingredients and feel satisfied so their normal bowl is just enough. My favourite ingredients are the mock fish, corn and one other veggie or meat depending on what I feel like. I'm not going to dock points, but there are some ingredients I feel are pretty rough and just don't fit in terms of flavour and texture, like the fishcake looking tofu has a grainy feel and is almost flavourless. Other than that, choose between savoury or sweet and sour sauces to complete your bowl. Oh, and their scrambled egg is top notch, extremely creamy, soft and fluffy if you're an egg fan.

I dined in, and the experience was OK. Not too cold or hot, sometimes I guess one or two flies will make their way in due to the lack of a strong air-conditioning curtain? So one star off.

Service is excellent, staff is friendly, attentive and quick."

I fundamentally believe if you don't like your job you should either quit or do something about it and not vent it on the business's customers. Either the owners is oblivious to the situation or the staffs are putting up a front.

Staff wasnt patient at all when we asked about the ingredients displayed as there were no descriptions and it's our virgin visit. Asked for napkins if possible upon checkout and all 3 front staff quickly jumped on aggressively to say don't have, saw tissues at the cashier counter and asked if I could have one if not I could buy it and they said that's kitchen towels and not tissues so no. After seating down heard the staff complaining among themselves of how they haven't had their off days. I guess they are overwhelmed as they were are seating inside the counter on a toilet stool when we walked in. The place was empty tho with only 1 table of 2pax.

Food was good and super value for money as recommended by a fellow alumni. I personally feel it's underpriced for the quality.

To the owners I hope you're seeing this as you have a great business given your NTU story, and it will be a waste if you lose customers over stupid unnecessary things like this. Super great fast service business model with exceptional prices and the last key to the lock is to have basic decent human to human respect from the service staffs.

The Place
The al-fresco restarant was situated on the top floor of a building. It consists of a hugh dining hall, but was simply decorated. From the open sides, one can admired the sea view and the diners of the other restaurant below. The walls were decorated by tacky neon lights and letterings (seem like the trend in interior decoration of restaurants nowadays)
The Service
The service was attentive and efficient, but the serving staff seems a bit overwhelmed and short-handed on the weekend evening that I visited the restaurant.
The Food
Green curry chicken: the taste was robust, the curry thick, but did not stand out from those by numerous other Thai restaurants. Fried glass noodle with seafood: the noodle was nicely fried with adequate 'wok-hei', but the seasonings was average, and might be a tad too salty (for me).
Thai style grilled beef with special sauce: the beef was nicely grilled and seasoned, presented in a bed of salad. The special sauce seems like an overkilled option.
Grilled squid with Thai dipping sauce: the squid was perfectly grilled, and nicely seasoned. This was perhaps the best dish of the lot. The accompanying bed of salad looked exactly the same as that from the grilled beef. Perhaps the chef needed to be more imaginative in his plating.
BBQ Thai Style (Moo Ping): I got this Thai 'satay' because it seems like good value - two sticks with two pieces of grilled pork each for $6. It was competently done with good smoky flavour.
The Verdict:
Good value Thai cuisine in an exotic location, with good ambience and a nice view."

We tried signature items like the Deep Fried Pork Knuckle, Seafood Tom Yum Soup, Squid, and others like Mango Salad and Kangkung.

The Deep Fried Pork Knuckle was crispy and juicy, though it had a hint of gaminess. The Seafood Tom Yum Soup was excellent, flavourful and a good amount of ingredients for 3-4 people. Kangkung was also cooked well. The Mango Salad was okay, nothing outstanding about the taste. However the squid did not taste great - there was no sauce or flavouring to it and it did not taste fresh.

Overall the food is still pretty good albeit pricey. The view is also nice."

It‚Äôs a warm invitation rooted in Thai culture, one that I experienced firsthand during my visit to Kin Kao Mai Thai Bistro at their Sembawang Yacht Club branch.

Set against the stunning backdrop of the Johor Strait bordering Malaysia, the evening offered more than just authentic Thai cuisine.
From the open dining area, the sunset skyline painted the horizon with breathtaking colours, making the meal even more memorable.

While waiting for our dishes, nothing beat a chilled glass of lemongrass drink in hand. Light, fragrant, and subtly sweet, it was the perfect refresher to cool down from the lingering heat of the afternoon sun.

Lemongrass Drink - $4.80

The first dish to arrive was the glass noodles with seafood, a savory, flavor-packed plate that immediately caught our attention. The noodles were springy and well-seasoned, tossed with plump prawns, squid, and vegetables. What stood out were the charming star-shaped carrot cuts, adding a playful touch to the presentation. The vibrant colors made the dish as visually enticing as it was delicious. Every bite was a delightful mix of textures and umami, truly satisfying.

Fried Glass Noodles with Seafood - $14

Next came the Seafood Tom Yum Soup served in a less spicy version, yet no less flavorful. The broth leaned toward the sweeter side, striking a comforting balance between tangy and aromatic. It was incredibly addictive, especially with the generous portion of plump, succulent prawns that soaked up all the zesty goodness. Each spoonful warmed the soul without overwhelming the palate, making it perfect for those who enjoy tom yum with a gentler kick.

Seafood Tom Yum - $15

We also had the Breaded Thai Fish Cakes, a plate of four golden, crispy pieces that were just the right size for sharing. Each bite revealed a springy, flavorful interior, rich with herbs and spices. Dipping them into the accompanying sweet plum sauce added a lovely contrast of sweet and savoury, making the experience totally indulgent. Simple, satisfying, and undeniably tasty.

Thai Fish Cakes - $12

The Deep-Fried Chicken Wings with Thai Herbs were a hit as well. Crispy on the outside and juicy within, they were infused with the aromatic depth of Thai herbs that added an extra layer of flavor. Each wing was satisfying and well-seasoned , a great finger food that paired perfectly with the rest of the meal.Best restaurants near me

Deep-Fried Chicken Wings with Thai Herbs - $10

The Crackling Pork Knuckle was another standout , perfectly deep-fried to a golden brown with a shatteringly crisp skin that lived up to its name. Hearty and bold, it was a great addition to our spread and ideal for sharing.

Crackling Pork Knuckle - $30

The Deep-Fried Sea Bass with Sweet Chilli Sauce was thoughtfully prepared, the fish was already portioned into battered, bite-sized chunks, making it incredibly easy to enjoy without the hassle of bones. The sweet chilli sauce was mild and complemented the crisp, golden exterior without overpowering the delicate flavour of the fish. It was a well-executed dish that balanced convenience with taste.

Deep-Fried Sea Bass with Sweet Chilli Sauce - $35

After dinner, we took a leisurely stroll by the water and stumbled upon a quirky surprise, a tree adorned with a pair of oversized rolling eyes. Its playful look made it instantly Instagram-worthy, standing cheerfully against the scenic straits and twilight sky. It was the perfect light-hearted end to an already delightful evening at Kin Kao Mai Thai Bistro."

Location quite ulu, so quite discrete.

Initially didn‚Äôt want to promote this place worrying it will get crowded. But their food was great and service is superb, they deserved to be shared.

Place was windy during that evening, nice place to chill.

All their food tastes great, not too overly flavored, just nice. Was hoping their squid can be more crispy.

Overall is superb. A place i definitely will return."

The Steamed Seabass with Lime and Garlic is a fresh, zesty masterpiece, perfectly balancing the tangy lime and aromatic garlic.

the Crispy Pork Knuckle is a must-try. It‚Äôs golden, crunchy, and oh-so-satisfying.

Kin Kao Mai takes it up a notch with their Pad Thai Noodles with Prawns‚Äîchewy, flavorful, and packed with the perfect amount of sweetness and spice.

Green Curry Chicken creamy, aromatic, and just the right amount of heat.

Don‚Äôt miss the grilled pork Jowl either‚Äîtender, smoky, and utterly addictive."

The restaurant is located at Sembawang Yacht Club, and it's perfect for a breezy, chill-out evening with delicious Thai food!

The Crackling Pork Knuckle was hands down the star of the night. The skin was sooo crispy, giving a satisfying crunch with every bite, while the inside remained juicy and tender. A perfect dish for sharing!

We also tried their Steamed Seabass with Lime & Garlic. The fish was fresh, and the combination of lime and garlic broth gave it a sharp, tangy kick. So appetising and pairs beautifully with plain rice.

The Grilled Squid was lightly charred and tender, grilled just right with a subtle smokiness. Dipped in their spicy and tangy sauce, it was a flavour bomb."

What a great decision that was. Huge portions , authentic Korean cuisine (taste as good as the meals I had in Seoul), and lovely service from the wonderful staff.

As I'm bringing a pet , I've to be seated in the outdoor area, but never once did I have to fight to catch the attention of the staff. In fact, they constantly check on me to see if I like the food or if I require anything.  Top notch service , miles ahead of many that charges the 10% but provide limited to no service. üëè

I am actually pretty full after my main dish, but I can't resist ordering a bingsu, and while I had no regrets ordering that as it was delicious, I ate myself to the point I almost threw up lol.

Case in point, i love the place, and I would definitely be back again with hsiao bai. Although I do have the tiny wish that pets are allowed indoors like the outlet in Poiz Centre in future."

We also had a dish of fried kimchi mandu which was filled with generous filling. We were already very impressed with the fried chicken so the dumplings paled in comparison by a little bit.  For our mains, we tried the Jajang Rabokki as well as Budae Jigae (army base stew). The army base stew was very savoury and filling... i enjoyed the soup alot as i loved hotpots even in our sweltering hot weather. for the jajang robboki, it was something new to us. the jajang sauce was quite light so it was a nice pairing with the ramyeon noodles, cabbage and mandoo. for 5 girls, we ordered both pots in M size cause we were still hungry after the robboki. think probably a L sized portion would have been better for dinner appetite. Highly recommend this place for quiet night out with the best buddies to catch up after work and don't have to fight for space. We were able to make reservations. Recommend ladies to wear pants or something comfortable as we were given the high tables. Else do make mention that you prefer a normal table seating. Costs $10 for us to Grab ride from YCK MRT station. Hope the nice boss and lady boss will consider extending happy hours privilege for guests maybe pegged to a certain spending requirement? üòäüòä would come back again to try other items on the menu especially the bingsu.

Big menu for a little kitchen.

Fried chicken tasty. Not from frozen commercial bags. Deboned, moist and tender. Sauces used, won't make you feel diabetic.

Steamed pork belly was bland, but thankfully accompanying fermented soy bean paste made up for it in that department. Could've been more enjoyable if it came with fresh cut green chilli, garlic slices and more lettuce leaves.

Meal here doesn't come with the usual free flow of banchan side dishes. These goes for $5.50 a portion. Very yum crunchy cabbage kimchi that's haven't yet been fully fermented.

Bits of seafood in every bite of pancake. Though personally prefer more spring onion for its aroma and punch. Maggi dipping sauce gave an interesting twist.

Food overall was alright. Prices a little high given its location.

Happy hour alcohol deal here are great! $38 towers and ‚Äô3 for 2‚Äô bottle offers, Thank you very much!

POS system was really annoying, given limited options and inflexibility for customers like myself, or those with the practice of placing lengthy meals and multiple small order throughout. Imagine being asked to furnish credit card details 8-10 times for one meal."

This store no exception. I love the korean fried chicken. Jajangmyeon, at first feel a bit bland but it seems the sauce wasn't stir properly, it was ok. The pork bulgogi was good but the price seems a bit expensive.

Kimchi was good, especially the cucumber kimchi and they are free refill.

Service was fine. Owner was friendly. Price has no additional GST and service charge.

It wasn't that pack when I visited Friday night. We enjoyed the place and ambience there with KPOP stars sticker everywhere.

The ordering system was not easy to use. I had problem with the internet over there and had to connect to their Wi-Fi. I thought I selected wrong menu cause the menu never change. If only the ordering was easy. It would be better experience. Also note that no cash accepted sign at the cashier. Order with phone would give 5% cashback. I tried to use the cashback to purchase dessert on the same day, it was blocked because payment need to be minimum of $1, I had to adjust the cashback amount to be used. I got problem with the system but the owner's daughter as the waiter there helped me on the ordering.

And the parking on this place for commercial usage only fit about 15 cars or less. I couldn't find any when I visited for dinner.

If only these two are addressed, it would have been a 5 stars review."

We tried a variety of dishes including mutton, beef, beef tripe, and chicken satays, along with fried sambal hor fun, claypot seafood crispy noodles, chicken and seafood fried rice, BBQ sambal stingray, and prawn omelette. The satays were well-seasoned and taste great with the peanut sauce, which was flavourful with peanut bits. It's a quaint spot with affordable and delicious food, ideal for a laid-back dining experience."

Babat satay was not too bad but the beef and lamb was a bit tough.

When we told the staff, they were kind enough to replace with new ones.

Waiting time was okay. All came about the same time.

My only issue is the restaurant looks quite old, giving a little bit of JB vibe.

Best to bring an umbrella for the walk to the restaurant. It could be too sunny or might rain. No shelter!

Spent about $178 for 4 pax."

We ordered a few dishes and unfortunately, the experience was quite disappointing. The fried ee mian was particularly bad ‚Äî the oil used for frying tasted old and reused, which left a really unpleasant aftertaste. On top of that, the sauce was bland, and overall the dish just didn‚Äôt work for me at all.

We also tried some of their dim sum. The fried mango prawn dim sum was another miss ‚Äî once again, the bad oil taste stood out, and the mango was bland and tasteless, far from the sweet flavour you would expect. As for the chee cheong fan and fried carrot cake, they were alright, nothing exceptional but at least edible.

Overall, I would say this place is just alright, but given the quality of the food, I would seriously reconsider visiting again."

But only to one specific person. I refer to the person whom I had asked around other staff if she is the supervisor, and they said yes, and to highlight she is the supervisor (chinese speaking Vietnamese lady). Here's how it went down.

Was browsing the menu at the door when the supervisor came to ask if we (my spouse & I) wanted to take a seat. As we were still considering, we told her we would just take a look first, we went on looking around the food court and eventually decided upon Uncle Leong. After we were seated, we decided on the 2 pax set menu when I raised my hands to get the attention of the service crew, which happens to be the supervisor. I asked about the poster on the table of scanning the qr code for a $1 drink.

The issues
1. The poster states only coconut, ah yu jelly, etc. I pointed out to the supervisor, and immediately, I was rebutted. ""Oh, it's up to us to decide what drinks to offer, so now changed to this this and this,"" pointing to the drinks menu.

Woah, I sound like a cheap skate freebie hunter at this point.

2. My wife decided on the choice with the set and placed her order. At this point, the supervisor seems to be irritated with our order speed and proceeded to say she will go send the order first while my wife finishes scanning the qr code.

We started to wonder if we weren't qualified to be eating at this restaurant ü§î.  Maybe what we ordered is not those of the higher class dishes.

3. Drinks served wrong, we ordered a lime juice & a peach tea, came 2 lime. The other server at this time was great üëç thumbs up for him (prc guy). He quickly apologised and brought us the changed drink.

Food choice we served wrong, one of the bean curd we ordered was the hotplate, but came Á∫¢ÁÉß. We decided not to be picky about it and just ate what was served.

The order was taken by the supervisor. This obviously shows how interested is she on her work.

4. Next table hoo Haa. Overheard the conversation of another table with the same supervisor. The other table ordered 2 set meals, but the supervisor specifically said that she keyed in already, she cannot revert. It seems to me that the other table had ordered 2 set meals for 3 to 4 pax. But I was already causing some confusion. I saw the same irritated side eye roll of the supervisor...

5. The second table commotion, a couple came in again attended by the dame supervisor, this time they were talking about voucher or promos they had bought online. What again that attracted me was, the supervisor exclaimed, ""This I can't decide! I'll call my management and let them speak to you.""

The ironic part is that after she called the management, she passed the mobile to the customer, and she went around gossiping and pointing towards the table of the customer holding her mobile. How rude!

To wrap this up. If a business that fails at any one point, this ""Supervisor"" is the cause of all the reputation, the chefs effort, discredited the other kind service or the other crew. Straight to the point, she behaves as if she's a successful business owner (maybe she really is) that does not need our poor peasants business.

What an unpleasant dinner experience we've had that spoils my whole evening. I hope the other tables also put up  a review so that it does justify what I've been through and witness.

To be fair, other than this supervisor, I have no issue with the taste of the food. The other service crews attitude were good too. I guess it up to the management to re-educate the customer service of your staff. Or you may attempt to write a ""look into the matter"" to brush away my elaborated review. Let's see how it all works out again when we return."

Order taking was quick and food was served in double quick time.

We came on a Friday lunch time and was relatively quite pack. Was able to make reservation before hand too and accommodate for 14 people. The food was great and everyone was satisfied with the food. The view outside the restaurant is very scenic too. We didn‚Äôt wait very long and the other tables of customers were also enjoying the yusheng; lot of customers coming down with their office colleagues. Great place for lunch or dinner. Recommended!

This restaurant offers a wide selection of local, western, chinese, seafood dishes in their menu. I ordered the chinese Set Menu for dinner. The steam fish was fresh and all the dishes were delicious. The price was reasonable. Ordered the mocktails which were sweet-sour and refreshing. Simple setting with minimal decorations and the place can be quite noisy if fully seated. Do take note that there is no toilet and the nearest one is quite a distance at the park. A good place to have dinner looking out into the sea and JB."

Love all dishes and the crab ü¶Ä was the best. We have abt 12 of us and the bill came to $800. Staff is not so attentive to those sitting right inside. Need to walk out to get staff attention. Other than that. The food quality is worth the price.

Admittedly we knew that they were good with crab dishes, but for this time we didn‚Äôt order any crabs. This review is based only on what we ordered.

Overall a decent place to come for zhi char, with dishes cooked well.

Of the dishes we ordered, the kai lan done two ways was interesting (first time I‚Äôve tried it). The Guinness pork ribs was cooked well although the taste of Guinness was very mild. The clam bee Hoon was ok, although the bee Hoon was a bit wet for my taste ( probably from the xo sauce)."

We had to wait a few times from order time (understandable) but also between each of the dishes. Maybe it's the system. I would have thought all dishes ordered by  each table should be served before serving the next table. Especially when in a hurry, we could finish faster this way. But no, 3 dishes came out of the kitchen went to 3 tables. Chilli and sauces are self-served which is both good and bad. I didn't know so asked a waitress, She told me to help myself and she went away, so I helped myself. Perhaps she could serve this time since we asked.

Shimmering Sand crab delight was overcooked. The sauce is interesting in my opinion. Mini wok Beancurd is a pale comparison to those I have at zi char stores. Druken prawns is decent. Guinness Pork Rib is quite impressive; the meat is nicely done, however, because of the environment once cold its not as nice. Traditional pork rib is very bland so you can skip over."

I never knew that deep fried Kai lan leaf feels so good. Love the tanginess of sunkist pork ribs as well, it‚Äôs still have sweetness from the sauce, good that the tangy taste is a bit dominant than the sweetness, if not it will taste like pork ribs dessert. Love the drunken prawn as well. Some drunken prawn taste too herbal while some other had strong alcohol scent and rough white wine taste, but uncle Leong‚Äôs is perfectly balanced, it‚Äôs smooth, fragrant and umami. It‚Äôs too good until It didn‚Äôt last for 5 minutes after served on the table (even for me to take picture).

My verdict:

- Malacca Truffle Oil Cheese Bee Hoon (SGD17.5, small) is quite a disappointment. The dish is not savoury and the cheese flavour is too strong and thick. I personally feel it is quite overpriced considering the portion and the ingredients. Not recommended.

- Chili crab (SGD50 for a piece of 500-600g crab) is a little too spicy for me. The crab is fresh and quite meaty.

- Ice Jelly drink Áà±ÁéâÂÜ∞ (SGD3) is refreshing and cooling. Nice.

- Staff service is not bad despite the crowd and peak hours.

Came across some of their bundle set in the menu, which seem quite value for money."

Food was just so so. And nobody told us that the 1-2 person or 4 person set meal is not available till we wanna order.

1. Vegetable is alright
2. Crab meat fish maw soup is not too bad
3. Cereal chicken is just passable and the chicken seemed to have more skin than meat
4. Fried rice is ok
5. Soy sauce prawn is over cooked and kinda tough, tad too sweet
6. Box tofu is ok.

Ordered 4 drinks for the 4 pax and costs about $104. I think price wise its alright."

Today afternoon (21-09-2024), I bought Meal with Mutton Intestine and chicken fry parcel, total cost $10.50 they charged, when i reach and ate the mutton totally no salt... really very sad, you people are charged so much but even your never taste it before serve to customer, it does not cheap!!!

when you're in hungry, if totally no salt in the food how you going to eat ????? ridiculers. it's about $10.50.

My strong recommendation to everyone, don't take parcel from this place.  if you want to eat just eat there. stupid people never taste before serving, and also charging too expensive...

It cost me around $9+. Though the price is a bit steep, I can understand that rental and it being in an ‚Äúulu‚Äù area demands that it charges higher prices for menu item. So I will not comment on the value for money aspect.

However, I did find the portion size to be a bit on the paltry side of life.

The fish soup was not filled with many ingredients, and the fish slices were a bit too fishy for my liking.

The fried fish slices is my biggest complaint unfortunately. They were mostly like off cuts of the fish, and I barely tasted any flesh and most of it was just fried coatings (or with such little fish that it only tasted like coating). Overall, it did not make for a satisfying meal.

Their menu is extensive, and I still want to try more of what‚Äôs available before making a final call. I see that they have different outlets around Singapore so I am definitely willing to try out their other outlets before coming to a conclusion. But so far? This is not a place I will come back to."

The hor fun comes with smooth, tender noodles drenched in a rich, savoury gravy. What makes it special is the wok hei ‚Äì that smoky, charred aroma that lingers with every bite, proof that the chef knows how to work the fire. It‚Äôs the kind of dish you crave on a rainy evening. On the other hand, the milky fish soup is hearty in a different way. The broth is creamy yet light, with a natural sweetness that blends beautifully with the fresh, firm slices of fish. It warms you up instantly, offering comfort without being cloying. Paired together, these two dishes show off SZ Kitchen‚Äôs ability to deliver both wok-fired boldness and homely, soul-soothing flavours. A real hidden gem in Joo Koon."

In the end, accepted that they served me a medium plate.

After ordering 4 mains from the self ordering kiosk, my family sat down and waited. The system calling the order was found to be based NOT in order of Q number. Worse, one staff has to key in the Q number based on whichever dish is cooked and handed to him.

Something was amiss after 30 mins and we found our Q number not being called while Q number after ours were called.

It was observed a lot of people waiting at the counter and I noticed dishes which we ordered were taken away. It occurred to me that people were not waiting for the Q number and simply taking the dishes on their own. I was pretty sure as I saw the Q number of the receipt from the people taking the food was many numbers after ours.

After waiting closed to 50 minutes, we gave up and asked for the refund."

Ordered a salted egg chicken rice, not alot of chicken meat and alot of flour, salted egg tasted bland. Made a mistake to top up $2 for soup, did not expect soup to come with fried flour bits and a piece of ngoh hiang.

Ordered fish soup as well, color of the soup is different from the top up ones, soup is flavourful though but the minced meat ball is too starchy and after the meal, we felt very thirsty. Overall still needs some improvements.

The photo below is a dissection of the fried flour bits in the top up soup."

Not bad at all, chicken was tasty and tender. Portion size is super generous compared to most places, maybe because they use bigger chickens? Even the rice they give is a lot.

Price is really decent, quite rare to find this kind of value nowadays.

The auntie might seem a bit grumpy at first, but she‚Äôs actually really nice. I asked to change one half to roasted, and she helped check if there was any ready at the back, had to walk all the way around the stall to do it too.

The rice was very fragrant and I can smell its aroma in the car even though I put the rice in the boot.  They were generous with the chili and soy sauce.  However, I find the chili too spicy for my liking but the 'sweet' soy sauce is good enough for me.  We were pleasantly surprised that the roast chicken was so tender and juicy.  I haven't eaten roast chicken for a very long time because among the many stalls that I have tried, the roasted chicken tends to be dry, so naturally I'm impressed with this roasted chicken. The steamed chicken is equally tender and some collagen can be seen nicely coagulated on some of the pieces. However, it can be observed that at the bottom of the box, some of the chicken blood has mixed with the chicken juices and leaving a reddish liquid at bottom of the box with the cut chicken in it and that sort of affected my appetite.

But overall, I love the rice and the roasted chicken very much. I will definitely come back for it again! However, expect to queue for a bit though."

Reached at 1030am, am 2nd in the line.
chicken Abit on blend side but u can add the sesame light sauce
Chilli is spicy and good
Rice Abit sticky to my liking. Think can compact into those chicken rice ball where they sell in melaka. The stickiness is of such.
Price: reasonable $12 for half chicken
Overall good but I compared with marsiling feng feng $13 half chicken. I prefer marsiling feng feng but the latter cost $1 more for half chicken."

The rice is mildly coated with chicken oil.

The steamed chicken is tender even for the lean part. 4*

The highlight would be the roasted chicken. I was blown away by how juicy the roasted meat and it was very well flavored and tender. 5*

The soup is mild and forgettable.

The price is very reasonable for $13 and $25 for half and whole chicken respectively."

Personally, I will grade this as not bad but not exceptional. There are much better chicken rice out there that I prefer.  The rice is aroma and not too oily, the meat is tender such that the bite is not too tough, esp for the breast meat.

Queue starts to form as early as 11+ in the morning with many orders coming in. Do expect to queue at least 15-30 mins during peak."

Arguably the best in Jurong.  Went to a famous brand chicken rice (LK) yesterday and paid a premium for it but still can‚Äôt hold a candle to this neighbourhood chicken rice stall.  Probably the main issue with this stall is queue can be really really Long during peak hours and I have encountered numerous time when workers ordered 10-20 packets which exacerbated the waiting time.  Queue usually form around 11am and their chicken rice usually sold out around 2pm.  Finding a Table can be a issue at this Coffeeshop too. Roast chicken seems to be a more popular choice for the masses compared to their ‚Äòwhite‚Äô chicken due to the flavourful and rich roasted chicken skin!  price wise ($3.50), it‚Äôs reasonable and cost about the same price as any neighbourhood chicken rice stall.

The white chicken sometimes a little too raw for my liking but it is tender. Usually we will order half a chicken, may it white or roast. As i love varieties, we will complete our meal with liver, gizzard, char siew and roast pork. My son loves their char siew sauce with rice. It is very different from other stalls. Their chillies, black sauce and minced ginger enhance the flavour further.  Somehow the stall is rather popular, food get sold out by noon at times.  They also get bulk orders and you may be disappointed not getting your food after queuing for almost half an hour. So be early."

It doesn't really help when there are 2 eating facilities at different levels within the exhibit ""Ocean Network Express Penguin Cove,"" both called Penguin Cove.

Let me assist with clarifying the confusion since I already went to visit both. üëç

üêß Penguin Cove Cafe & Shop
This sits right at the feeding area of the penguins, where you are separated by small barriers from the guests. You get to buy mini pastries, drinks, and Penguin themed snacks.

And of course, their cutest Penguin Bao ($3.90) consisting with red bean filling in a really dense bao texture. The chicken pie & other butter pastry puffs are pretty good. It is great for families who want a quick snack and cool down with the kids. My total bill came up to be $41 for lunch here and my sister and I were so stuffed till dinner. üëç

üêß Penguin Cove Restaurant.
It's a legit restaurant in the basement that serves buffet food, high tea, and ala carte dishes if you're open to dining in at tables with table ware. The deep diving area of the penguins can be seen here as you ate.

Rather small and quite empty looking, the prices here are rather exorbitant. There is a 50% promo for 2nd diners going on until 2 pm on weekdays, we were allowed to take a look at what was offered before deciding, and we bailed.

Though the variety and food variety were pretty okay, like baked fish, cold cuts, laksa etc, there were only 2 rows of food and its honestly not worth breaking the bank at $80+ dollars for 2 after discount and taxes. And plus, we want to spend the time visiting other exhibits. Honestly, if per pax, the buffet food was $25 - 30++, I would consider."

Penguin Cove Restaurant is the one that I've consistently found it a convenient spot for lunch during my visits.  While they offer a good variety, I  recommend their signature Fish and Chips.

On my most recent trip, I also tried the new Chicken Cutlet and Fries, which was pretty good. The accompanying mushroom sauce was especially delicious ‚Äì I couldn't resist generously coating the cutlet with it.

Beyond the food, the staff truly elevates the dining experience.  Their friendly smiles and willingness to help make a noticeable difference.

And let's not forget the unique ambiance.  Enjoying lunch while watching penguins dive and swim is a truly delightful and memorable experience that makes dining here even more special. Consider bringing your loved ones here. üòâ"

The food here is fresh, although for its portion, the price can be a bit steep. Overall, the indoor seating area is well ventilated with a relaxing view overseeing the water.

Note that only set menu is available, which begins from 7 pax (we paid 100+ per pax since we had fewer than 7 pax). You can request for non spicy options.

Unfortunately, I have to rate this restaurant 2 stars due to my disappointment and poor communication with the staff. 5 days before visiting, I requested for 2 of the dishes to be served non spicy. The admin nicely acknowledged and confirmed this. However, all of the original spicy dishes were served on the day itself. I called the admin via WhatsApp as I did not see any staff around and the waiter could not really speak English. A lady picked up and said she'll help me check on it. However, I did not hear back from anyone (even after 24 hours). Probably will not visit again üòÖ"

We bought our experience through klook, quite fuss free as you‚Äôd message the restaurant to check availability & organise. Dinner timing is a little early (we arrived 3.45pm, apparently ferry is 4.30, but the bum boaters were nice to take us to the restaurant early). Happy to be back to mainland before sunset.

Upon arrival at Changi ferry terminal, bum boat will take you to restaurant. Workers at the restaurant are absolutely amazing- we added an extra fish for $48 (reasonable price). Apparently they also do take aways where they freshly catch their farmed fish, descaled & vacuum at $20.

The drinks & add ons are inevitably slightly pricy than mainland but you‚Äôre truly paying for a different dine in experience."

Each of the 2 ferries took 10 of us, and we occupied 2 tables. I had pre booked the 10 course meal for each table of 10 at $780 per table inclusive of the ferry ride (best valued set). We were very happy with our dinner. The steamed fish, fried calamari rings, steamed prawns, chilli crab, lobster and other dishes were all very fresh and nicely done. We managed to finish most of our food despite initially thinking that we won‚Äôt be able to eat much for such an early dinner. ü§≠

Overall, it was just a nice experience to be able to take a boat out and do something different like this in Singapore. The ferry ride each way was only about 15mins and very calm. Even those who were at first concerned about motion sickness, were perfectly fine. Smith marine closes at 7pm and we had to leave by then,  mainly because of safety reasons as the ferries do not run after sunset in the dark."

From the moment I arrived, the ambiance was nothing short of breathtaking. Set on a beautiful floating platform, the views of the water and surrounding nature are simply stunning. It felt like a tranquil escape from the everyday hustle and bustle.

The service was exceptional. The staff were welcoming, attentive, and made us feel right at home. They took the time to explain the menu and made great recommendations. The food itself was absolutely delicious. The seafood was incredibly fresh, and every dish was packed with flavor. I highly recommend trying the grilled lobster‚Äîit was perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection. The menu offers a variety of options, catering to different tastes, and the portions are generous.

What really stood out to me, though, was the overall experience. Dining on the water, with the gentle sway of the restaurant, created a truly unique and memorable atmosphere. It's the perfect place for a romantic dinner, a special celebration, or even a casual outing with friends.

If you're looking for great food, amazing service, and a one-of-a-kind dining experience, Smith Marine Floating Restaurant is a must-visit. I can't wait to return!"

When we got there, we were offered the opportunity to catch our own fish for lunch at the back of the restaurant. We ordered a set lunch which included crab, fish and other dishes. Do note that the place does not serve alcohol. Food was ok (not fantastic, and definitely cannot compare with food from the mainland), there were some flies to deal with while eating. It was generally a good and interesting experience, but considering costs and everything else, I would do this occasionally - perhaps once in a long time.

They have seating arrangements apart from the dining space if you want to spend some time. Only negatives are the time restrictions; need to leave Changi Ferry point at 4pm and have to finish dinner by 7pm and they don‚Äôt have alcoholic beverages (nor they allow to bring) due to halal certification.

What stood out most was her sincerity, she took the time to recommend dishes, advised us not to over-order since we only had four people, and made sure we felt comfortable. Despite having to walk extra rounds for customers, she never once showed frustration or a grumpy face.

Her warmth and attentiveness made the dining experience feel homely, and her constant smile really brightened up our day. Staff like Ms Ng make a huge difference, and we truly appreciate her service."

The boat ride is about 25mins one way. We left around 1630hrs and came back at 1830, reaching mainland around 1900hrs.

Food was tasty, but portions were somewhat disappointing for the prices paid perhaps due to 5pax per table. The variety was excellent! We enjoyed the crab, mussels and vegetables! No soup was provided and steamed fish was threadfin!"

The restaurant was very helpful in helping to arrange my reservation and to coordinate the ferry for the day of over WhatsApp.

The whole experience was relaxing, from the ferry ride to/from and the time on the restaurant. We were able to play pool, sit, relax and chat as we drank some fresh coconut and lemongrass juice while we waited for our food to be prepared. It was great to get away from the city, take in the view and just unwind. A few of us were looking forward to fishing, but we were told it was not allowed/available when we arrived.

We had two tables of 6 people each and ordered the 7 course menu for each table. The portions were plentiful and everyone had their fill with a little left over remaining. Everyone said the food tasted delicious and a few even said it was the best food they have had while in Singapore during this past week (although, the desserts, both the grass jelly and the longan/sea coconut, were just ok).

The only complaints I have, which didn‚Äôt really detract from the overall experience, was:

1. They do not accept credit card payments. Only cash and payment apps that are not available for foreigners to use. Had to ask a local colleague to help arrange for initial deposit.

2. It was not possible to fish."

$488++ for 5pax meal which had around 6 courses and because they are halal they do not sell any alcoholic beverages.

Didn't manage to take pics of the later courses but the lala (clam) beehoon was the star of the show, even eclipsing the chili crab and steamed fish."

Cheap lobster and value for money was the tagline I so heard.

To be honest..prices are not expensive but size of the portion is small. Nothing to shout about. Lobsters at $15/piece were sold out when i came n the staff offered to replaced the lobster with 8 prawns at the same price...oh well..Nothing fantastic as well.

Sambal stingray at $15 but only one side of the fish was served. Small curry fish head at $23...that might have been some malnourished fish...not much meat..

Yam ring priced at $18 was full of dried chilli..

Didn't plan to order that many dishes at first but because the actual size were small n not too filling...ended up ordering more üòê seems to me like a marketing gimmick to attract patrons but I doubt i will be back again..there are better places with better food n pricing.

Well u can say one probably shouldn't expect too much with cheap prices, but to be honest I wouldn't mind paying more for better quality.

And it was a total turn off towards the end when i was still eating my fruit platter and the cleaner attempted to clean my dishes by dumping the remains from other tables into my fish head pot and left the whole thing right under my nose...."

Dried yee fu noodle - served not hot, 1 single prawn with few thin slices of pork cost $6. Not worth.

Thick Fish meat (yu jee) noodle soup- no authenticity to talk abt this item as a cantonese dish. Fish slices small in size, not fresh (mushy) and soup not the white milky type.

BBQ Stingray hotplate - I would like to rate this as 1 star dish as the worse stingray I had ever eaten! Portion extremely insufficient with lots of bones n fats, not meat! It's doesn't even tasted like it has been prepared through BBQ, likely was a steamed stingray n jus thrown into hot plate to served. Sambal cannot be called sambal n not the slightest spicy at all.
Worse the damage to wallet for such a dish was $18. Think I can get much better quality from normal hawker center.

Highly not recommended!!"

The seafood here is really fresh. I spoke to the owner and he told me that he goes to the market around 3-4 am just to get his hands on the fresh catches of seafood. That day I ate the baby shark as well, and I‚Äôm running out of adjectives so let‚Äôs just say it was delightful.

Received comments from the outlet to request for my email for follow up with my experience.
Nevertheless, have attempted to send email to the person from the outlet requesting for my email but the response was: the outlet email is not accepting any email connection. Seems that either the request is a fake request or something else.
Hopefully that the response is genuine and please resolve the connection issues.

After our last satisfactory experience from our last visit, we decided to try this outlet again and unfortunately, the experience is bad.
Firstly, the white bee Hoon is so sticky and more like typical hawker stall fried bee Hoon with hardly any gravy unlike our previous experience is more gravy or soupy and was tasty. If not for the prawn and scallop, it will be no different from the fried bee Hoon one get from any hawker stall. This is really great let down.
The stirred fried lalas was decently fried but seems like overly sweet, and tasted nothing but sweet. Except for the onions to
go with the lala is nicely fried , otherwise this dish is another great disappointment.
The dish, pork rib in traditional dark soy sauce seems more like pork rib soup but the rib is cooked nicely and the soup is reasonably tasty for soup. May be it is meant to be pork rib soup instead.
Only the fried veggie is properly cooked as per menu and was nicely done.
As a whole, the whole meal is a great disappointment as compared to our previous visit. Not sure if some things has gone very wrong. Will have to forget about visit this outlet again.
What is strange is that the waitress serving is  making a remark that we should have raised the issue with the bee Hoon which is totally without any gravy and she will deal with it as though she is not aware how the bee hoon dish was served. After I check the photo posted by other reviews, all are with generous amounts of gravy. This is a total lack of concerned about the quality of the dish. Which is really disappointing as this show a total lack of concerned for the quality of the food served."

About 15 minute walk from the LRT station.
Will recommend to take cab or drive in as the road before is not sheltered.

Ambiance is quite nice and good dining experience.

Overall, Xian's Seafood prices were quite reasonable.

Tastewaste, above average. However, do note that the ""crab congee pot"", along with the ""tasty ladyfinger"" is a total waste of money.

The service was above average: the boss and their staff were friendly.

*A downside to my visit was that I was made to wait 3 hours in total before being served my meal (1hrs to order).

Furthermore, many guests, including, my reservation were being cancelled unnoticed.

In conclusion, Xian's Seafood is not a restaurant I'll probably visit again.

*Could be due to a recent mediacorp review."

Firstly, I made a reservation but still have to look for my own table.

Secondly, the ordering of food is self-service which requires us to queue up at the cashier to order my food (which makes the reservation of table redundant as waiting time is still incurred)

Thirdly, after ordering the food, I waited for a total of 1h30mins before the first dish came. The serving of dishes came 1 dish at a time which makes the entire dining experience very bad.

This restaurant is not new to me. I have both dined in, got delivery and takeaway from the Simei and Ang Moh Kio Outlets. Food lacked freshness. The meat flavours were weak and superficial. The breads were rubbery. If this is a franchise, it warrants some QC to avoid tarnishing the otherwise relatively positive brand image."

But took a while for a staff to come over my table, take my order or even handover the menu. But that's alright as I see it's only one person doing this.

Tried their Fish Curry and it's decent. A little bit different type of cooking as the curry is thick and not the usual soupy ones. Good of course with their basmati rice.

Their sweet lassi was not bad to wash off the spice taste from the main course.

All the five stars reviews here upped my expectations but trolls can be easily bought. Though I'd give this place another chance and try their highlighted dishes and see if these reviews are indeed real."

Firstly, the delivery arrived without any cutlery, making it inconvenient to enjoy the meal.

Moreover, the taste of the biryani and chicken didn't align with my expectations. It lacked the authentic flavor I associate with biryani, leaving me questioning the value for money. It's disheartening when a dish fails to live up to its reputation.
Afterwards discuss with my friends all are already experienced the worst experience in this restaurant. I strongly recommend customers do not try this restaurant with your valuable money and time."

The only reason I'm heading there despite the low food quality is because of the cravings of the badam milk. And becos of this this cravings I have to drag my husband as well as he despise the food there. Today was exceptionally terrible as I wanted to have vegetarian meals with my badam milk and my.husband ordered thosei with pepper mutton. He was forcing himself to eat the thosei as it tasted terrible and the pepper mutton got stuck on one of his tooth where the pain was excruciating. He had a challenging time taking the stuckwd piece out of his tooth. He didn't eat afterwhich and went straight to the counter to pay. Waiter appears lethargy. If restaurant is busy I can apprehend on y he is lethargic but it was totally empty, I wonder y. Overall this is a lesson learn for me to go to YouTube and learn how to make badam milk instead of heading there just to satisfy my cravings. My husband strictly told me not to ask him to bring me there again. And I'll keep up to that promise after this."

So this is where sembawang hot spring is. There is a small zhi char style eatery just beside the entrance or the toilet.

There are a range of food to other from single pax rice and noodles to groups dishes and such. They do also served good breakfast sets as well. This place doesn't serve pork and lard, can't rmb issit halal certified or not.

So back to the food, so we called in to check out recommendation for our family luncheon. And they recommended some hidden menu items which need pre-order due to more prep work needed to be done.

So there is the few popular dishes like the winter melon soup, salted egg fried prawn, the beggar chicken(which you can hammer down, fun for the kids), crayfish. All these are hidden menu by the way.

Food is yummy by standard cause it's cooked and managed by non-other than uncle himself, which owns bottle tree zhi char last time (; super yummy.

The portion is huge and value for money, with us 10 pax we can't even finish all the food. Super worth trying and also friendly for families.

If you happen to come for lunch or dinner, the kids can also go to the hotel spring to make onsen egg and eat at the restaurant. It can be a pre- or post thing so, do plan some time for it as well (;

The place had aircon for hot day, and comfortable amt of seating inside and outside of the restaurant. The lady owner which is the daughter is very friendly, so as uncle and aunty, so don't hesitate come in buy and drink and say Hi (:

Alright that's all for now."

We wanted to try the laksa which we were told is only available on a Sunday. We ordered burnt bee hoon ( chao tar bee hoon) which had the lovely wok hei aroma and was not oily. Pleased. It did not have the burnt crispy bits that were expected in burnt bee hoon. Disappointed.

The fried hokkien prawn noodles was not mushy. It  was full of flavour from the stock used. The chilli sambal that came with it added an extra dimension to the taste. Pleased.

All the food served was warm and delicious!! The staff was friendly and I recommend checking this place out during off peak hours on the weekend as I heard that it can get quite packed during peak hours. We had such an enjoyable ktv session after our lunch. The sound system was really good and the song selection was up to date with all the latest chinese and english songs. An amazing place to hang and chill with your friends and family for sure!!

We ordered the squid ink pasta and fish and chips. The squid ink pasta was enjoyable, with a nice depth of flavor, but the fish and chips fell short‚Äîtoo dry, with an over-fried batter that lacked the light, crisp texture I was hoping for.

Unfortunately, the service was a major letdown. The staff seemed disengaged, mostly gathered around the bar area. Each time we needed something, I had to leave my seat to ask for assistance, which was disappointing. A more attentive and proactive approach from the team would have made a big difference"

Nice place to hang out for drinks. There‚Äôs live band on wed and Fri nights. Place is fully booked. Do come early/ make your bookings.

Snack platter at 30++ is okay, calamari can skip. Fries and wings are good.

Caesar salad cheese taste like goat cheese.
Kids meal‚Äôs mash potato with sausage, can skip too. Mash potato is not smooth and has a weird taste.

Live band starts on time and do not waste time talking away. Vocals and instrument use is good. Though would wish for more harmony singing since there‚Äôs two singers.

Food wise, we had chicken chop with mash, prawn aglio, bites platter.
Chicken chop tasted fine, mash flavour could improve. Taste like it's just potato and butter with no seasoning.

Bites platter - had fries, chicken karaage and chicken skin. Chicken skin is a major let down. It's chewy and oily, nowhere near crispy. Prawn aglio has nice plating, flavour wise ok, but portion is small.

Beer tower is affordable, 68 before service charge and gst.

Advert on their LCD screens says Safra member gets 15% off.. didn't spot the fine prints, but it's only for mains. Feels like false advertising.

Darts machine only accept darts live cards credits and no cash. Card sells for $22.

Hall KTV system is horrendous, could be just poor settings, but who knows. While I understand guests may have feedback that music is loud, it's now so soft that 100% music vol on the browser app doesn't even guarantee that you can hear the softer parts of the song. There doesn't seem to be reverb or echo set as well, which makes singing a chore.

Made a second trip here and tried their chicken cutlet and burger, as well as caesar salad and was really mehh too. Please do something about it."

We spent half a day exploring the fantastic facilities, and Zayn had an absolute blast at Bouncetopia. Safra Choa Chu Kang offers a wide range of activities including a spa, gym, bowling alley, and a very cool and chill swimming pool. Plus, there are plenty of eateries to satisfy any craving. ü§©

For dinner, we chose to indulge in western delights at PARADISE NOW which is conveniently located right next to the bowling alley. This spot is perfect for gathering with friends and family for a night of good food and entertainment. The restaurant boasts a beautiful bar, a darts game area, and even a live band that provides delightful music as you dine. The cozy setup truly enhances the overall experience, making it a great place for a fun night out with family.

At Paradise Now, we sampled some of their top mains, and each dish was a delightful culinary experience:

üê∑Superior Pork Rack: flavorful with a rich and savory glaze that enhanced its natural flavors.

ü¶ë Squid Ink Seafood Pasta: al dente pasta coated in a flavorful squid ink sauce, accompanied by a generous serving of fresh seafood, including prawns and squid.

üêü Beer-Battered Fish & Chips: crispy on the outside and flaky on the inside, paired with perfectly golden fries and a tangy tartar sauce.

üçã Lemon Posset: creamy and tangy treat, which was a refreshing end to our meal.

The live entertainment at Paradise Now added an extra layer of enjoyment to our dining experience.

1. Kids dine free with minimum spending of $30 per adult
2. Free set meal (comes with soup and drink) with any main course or pasta ordered.
We ordered 1 main course, 1 pasta and 1 kid's set meal. Honestly, I think the pricing there is rather steep (chicken chop at $19++, kid's set with only small burger and fries and a small cup of juice at $16++.), but was thinking with the above promotion, the price is reasonable. After ordering the food from the QR code given, and when the food is served, I checked with staff if my main course comes with free upgrade to set meal, as no soup and drink was served. Staff checked with manager (I believe) and came back to inform that as I didn't select set meal, they are unable to serve me with that. I showed her the order link which I have, doesn't have this set meal option and hence I thought it's a automatically upgrade. The staff went through my menu order site from my phone and indeed she can't find the set meal tab. She went off and came back to inform that she can see it in her phone and ask me to scan the QR again.
When I made payment at the cashier, I believed it's the manager who was at the cashier(she was talking to another staff on the roster I guess and I was made standing in front of the counter for a while, being ignored). I feedback on menu site and she said sometimes need to refresh the link to see the set meal tab and she was indifferent when she said that, which means it's obviously a bug on the site which they have encountered before and for customer who comes the first time will not be aware that they need to refresh link to see the complete menu order site. In this case, shouldnt the management do something about it?
Since it's a bug on the order site, why is customer penalise for it? Not that I yearned for the soup and drink from the set meal, I just feel that this could be handled better in a Food and Beverage establishment. Everyone knows that the cost price for a drink and soup is very minimal and can be easily given to customer for any service recovery.

Food is average, with the kid's meal served with hot fries but the fries served in the chicken chop plate was cold as it was served sometime later as the last dish. Oh yes, the menu selection is rather limited, with many items not available. (No idea why)

Hope the management will look into their menu order site and customer service."

However, my recent visit left me disappointed with the service.

While waiting for Kitty, I ordered a Guinness stout draft. I was told it would be delivered to me at the bowling alley, but after 15 minutes, I had to go to the counter to find it. It was sitting there, untouched, and I had to point out that I was the one who ordered it. It seemed like a simple mistake, so I let it slide.

Later, when Kitty joined me, we tried to use our Safra membership to get a 15% discount on our drinks.  We also wanted to get a small snack. When we approached the staff to ask about the discount and the snack, they seemed dismissive, saying it was ‚Äúonly a $3 discount.‚Äù  I was taken aback by this response ‚Äì it felt dismissive and unhelpful.  It‚Äôs not about the amount of the discount; it‚Äôs about how customers are treated and the tone used.

Adding to my disappointment, when I ordered my second drink, I was met with an unhappy expression when I showed my Safra card. And when I asked for a refill of peanuts, I was told it would cost $3.  Again, it was the tone, the lack of understanding of our request, that was most frustrating.

Unfortunately, these experiences have significantly lowered my opinion of the service at Paradise Now.  I'm still a fan of the venue and its atmosphere, but I hope the management will take a close look at their staff's interactions with customers. I can't recommend this place as highly as I once did, and I'm dropping a star from my previous review."

There is free WiFi and comfortable sofas, allowing you to relax for longer.
This is already my fourth time here and I hope to visit again."

Food was okay. I had the set meal but there was no soup of the day available so you are forced to order another soup that requires a top-up. Dessert was laughable - some jelly with fruits. Hot ice tea ordered was barely lukewarm when served. The Staff were like gathering around the bar area chatting instead of paying attention to customers. Can‚Äùt seem to even get the basics right.

Creative use of hashbrown grilled into a rosti like texture. Must try.
Fresh fish and chips using seabass and not frozen catfish.
Abit noisy from other patrons, maybe some sound proofing.
Good and prompt service."

The pan fried beehoon is nice! And I definitely recommend the nasi lemak, the sambal sauce is delicious. I even asked for more sambal sauce as the portion they gave was just too less for a plate.

Food not bad.  We ordered Nutella with butter toast set.  The eggs are served in the egg cooking container.  Wait for the hot water to finish dripping (traditional half-boiled egg cooking method).  They sell and rent buckets.  If you like to cook spring water egg but didn't bring any egg, can consider buying raw eggs from the cafe."

This eating place is situated just right in the middle of the pathway from the main entrance of Sembawang Hot Spring Park and the hot spring area.
While the place is small for sitting spaces, the menu offered here is sufficiently well fitting for teabreaks, small meals or just drinks to chill with friends or family."
