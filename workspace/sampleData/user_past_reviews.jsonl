{"user_id": "117689170846448249054", "name": "Mario D'Ambrosio", "review": "We worked with Dan at Cottonwood Landscapes starting May2015 through October2015.  As the owner of Cottonwood Landscapes, Dan came up himself & did the bid. He was overly friendly during this meeting & his bid came in at the best price! Our yard was a bit tricky because the back yard is a hill that slopes in to our home, so our goal was to ensure that all moisture would drain away from our house. Dan ensured us that this would be an easy issue to tackle. We ended up paying $6,000 over what his initial bid came in at! He left permit costs out of the bid claiming he did not know permits would be necessary. Dan never did his due diligence to find out if permits were needed. So when it came to the permits it was entirely up to me to secure them. I spent over 6 hours at the city figuring out what documentation I needed & who I needed to meet with in order to secure these permits. I had to measure out the walkway entirely by myself & draw up a diagram showing the city where the walkway would be in regards to the waterline. I ended up having to go to 2 DRT meetings because during the first meeting I did not have what I needed. I am not a landscape expert so of course I wasn't aware of all the documentation required. I had to get blueprints of the walkway plan from Dan's architect to present to the city & after all that work I did by myself at the city building I ended up having to pay Dan for the work of the architect. Please keep in mind I asked the architect to meet me at the meeting and he showed up 20 minutes late & missed the whole thing, but Dan charged me for his time anyway. Dan also didn't include the cost to move dirt, which is strange since our main concern was moving dirt so that moisture would not run in to our home, he claimed we opted out of dirt removal? & when it came to our patio Dan's plans only included 2 walls instead of the 3 it needed for completion. Dan completely left out the 3rd wall so we had an entire wall of dirt falling into our patio since the paver stones were not stacked up in a wall formation as they had been on the other 2 sides. Dan  also did not include the Rainbird sprinkler control dial in the bid. He included a sprinkling system yet charged us an extra $300 to put in a dial so that we could actually turn the sprinklers on. You would think the dial would be included in the sprinkler system but it isn't. He also apparently found the cheapest concrete company to work with for our front walkway. they dug the walkway out 6 inches too close to a fire hydrant, which required them to come back & do the job twice, while leaving excess dirt for us to deal with. While pouring the patio they damaged our driveway & we had to fight to get them to come back & correct the issue. They also completely over poured the walkway leaving edges that were not smooth, but instead had piles of hard cement connected to it. The concrete company also hid mounds of of extra cement underneath dirt in our front yard, which we found while shoveling ....Trying to remove the dirt that Dan didn't include in his contract. Another strange thing about working w/ Dan is every time I would write him a check i would make it out to Cottonwood Landscapes. Every time Dan would send these checks back requesting that I make them out to him personally, Dan Cloward. The only explanation I can think of for this is he was hiding income from the government or from his employees. In his contract, Dan promised that our project would be substantially completed within 2 weeks from the start date. The start date was supposed to be July 24. Dan missed the start date by a week & our project did not get finished until October. You can do the math! Dan seemed like such a nice guy when we first met him, but Dan became unresponsive after we signed w/ him. The only time he answered my calls was when I called him blocked, even though I called him unblocked seconds before. Do yourself a favor go with someone who seems a bit more expensive who will get the job done correctly and on time. It will save you time & $!", "rating": 1, "time": 1447743785393, "gmap_id": "0x87528fc8f9128ae9:0x624f85069f232c3"}

When you bank with a bank you look at what the bank CAN offer you!

I was soon to find out that was totally not my experience with this bank or this branch!!! 😫 A little while later I needed a ATM card really bad I called them and basically had to beg for a card like why!? Anyway I was told at first that I would be able to get a ATM card so I was so excited that I could finally have a card anyway I got a letter in the mail stating that I was denied the card and it wasn't coming! 😡 So again I started to get really upset I called customer service they weren't helpful at all and very rude....

I never once have wanted to give an apartment complex or almost any place multiple 5 star ratings 😁 thank you so much green leaf\n\nseems recent management change was a little bumpy at first, but we moved in about a month ago and have had a great experience. Management and office staff are quick to respond now and are very helpful. We hear heavy footsteps and dogs upstairs but overall it is a great community with great amenities! I hear people complain about internet packages but we now have WiFi and cable for $20 more than we were paying for wifi with century link. We love living here!\n\nAnd a few things I wanted to add after living here a bit longer, the grounds and apartment we are in are beautiful for a very reasonable price. The community fees get a little pricy but I think it is worth it to live somewhere so great. We lived at an awful complex for 2 yrs and this honestly feels like a palace haha. Neighbors are all very nice and respectful, keep to themselves. Office has continued to be very helpful. Someone took my parking space the other day and they dealt with it very fast and gave me another temporary spot, it was a huge help.

I went prepared to stand my ground as I know many dealerships can be pushy, but apparently wasnt as prepared as I should've been. It started off pretty chill, the guy who helped me was initially very friendly and took me to look at the lot and show me what would work with my down payment and credit. I told him from the beginning I really needed AWD for the winter. He showed me car after car that didn't have awd and at some point he said let me go run things thru the computer again and see if there's anything else I'm not seeing. I waited forever.. I swear they just use this as a tactic to get you feeling impatient and ready to buy. Came back... Almost an hour later... Showed me my credit history which I was well aware of and continued to tell me they couldn't sell me anything awd. Then he said there actually is one I can show you. Took me out to see a Jeep liberty, I showed a little interest then immediately he tried talking me into buying it that night without taking to my husband and just said to bring it back if he doesnt want it lol. I get that they are flexible with trades and have a policy that does make it easier but really?? Why would I purchase a car without discussing it with my husband 🤦‍♀️ then they ended up telling me the same thing about another car I didn't even want when I said payments on the Jeep were too high.

The longer we've lived here, however, the worse things have gotten. There's dog poop EVERYWHERE - I never walk on the grass if I can help it. Last summer the hot tub was either not working at all or had been closed by the Health Department. The maintenance staff is very responsive and friendly, but the management staff seems to turn over frequently. When we had an infestation of black widow spiders in our outdoor storage closet last year, we asked the apartment if they could take care of it, since we pay a monthly pest control fee. They said they would spray for the spiders, but would simply spray the insecticide all over our things in the closet. We had to take care of it ourselves, since we didn’t want our camping equipment and seasonal decorations covered in toxic spider spray. In the past few months, several unruly neighbors have moved in to the building next to us and made us seriously reconsider renewing our lease. I've been woken up at two in the morning by cars with thumping sound systems and drunken yelling. I've found used needles and burned pieces of foil in the parking lot. I never let my kids out of my sight and tell them to never pick up anything they find on the ground. The apartment also contracts with a predatory towing company, who placed a notice this morning on my car that it would be towed if I didn't fix a problem within 24 hours.

I was very hesitant to try this place out since who can compare to Hawaii fresh poke bowls to a landlocked state where quality fish isnt on every corner. Well guys, the fish was tasty, as in, melt in your mouth fresh. The restaurant didnt have any off fishy smells!! Which like many others know is a common smell in restaurants that serve \"fresh seafood\" in Utah. My only recommendation is for the staff to make sure the customer understands how ordering the bowl goes. I ordered the laid back poke bowl and she got to work and didnt ask any further questions so I presumed my order was ready to go. My friend who was behind me was having her bowl prepared and the employee helping her had offered samples of certain things and asking what toppings she wanted. It made me realize I had no toppings on my bowl and wondered why I wasnt asked if I wanted any. Unfamiliar with the process I didnt know if I could have toppings since i choose a signature bowl so I felt a little uncomfortable when I had to ask her to put toppings on after she was already done helping me.
