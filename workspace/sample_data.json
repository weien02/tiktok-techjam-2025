Its like buying a dress from Kohl's for the price of Armani. You might have a nice dress but its not worth $500, more like $30.\n2nd reason is how disingenuous the staff/owners are. They are here to sell, sell, sell you anything and everything whether you need it or not. It really does get annoying and frustrating. I did my hair there for about 6 months and haven't rescheduled after the last time when my hair didn't look the \"$300+\" bill I paid for it.

They post their hours but then change them when it's convenient and never seem to be open. They treat their customers like an inconvenience and make it as difficult as possible to buy anything from them. I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt but my last visit was the last straw. The owner, Rena, continued to give me the wrong sizes even though I made it clear several times which size would fit me best and then she dismissed me for taking too long. I made a rushed decision and when I came back to make an exchange due to buyer's remorse the door was locked and there were no business hours posted for that day (it was the middle of the day on a Saturday). The next time I tried to make the exchange the sales woman said I had to come back when the owner was there to make any exchanges. The next attempt I called first to make sure the owner would be there and Rena answered the phone. She actually lied to me and said Rena wouldn't be in until 2 that day. The woman is wack and the way she runs the place baffles me. The next time I buy a Marlies Dekkers bra I will just add it to my travel expenses because it certainly won't be from this place ever again.\nBy the way, for all the fake reviews, it's pretty obvious that a post is bias to the owner when there is no specific experience in the writing. No one cares about a \u201cgreat staff\u201d -they want to know what the staff does to be considered so great. When a business has this many bad reviews, the plan should be to fix the problems, not the reviews.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8752f502285f27fb:0xe96851b51c9ffba9", "relevant": "Yes"}

I arrived a few minutes before 9:00 and the person providing the service had not yet arrived, which was fine. I ended up waiting for a little over 15 minutes past my appointment time for her to arrive. When she did arrive, there was no apology for running late or a thank you for waiting, nothing. So we went back and the service started. With the gel nail polish removal, the tool slipped out of her hand and nicked my toe, again, no apology or asking if I was ok (and I was fine, however an indication of making sure of that is showing a basic level of customer service.) The rest of the nail polish application was fine.\n\nThe soaking, scrubbing, and massage were all very quick, which was extremely disappointing. The most disappointing was how quick the massage was. When I am paying this price point, I expect a much, much better and longer massage.  My pedicure started at 9:17/9:18 am and ended at 10:07 am. The online booker indicated the service was 1 hour, 15 minutes. The service I received was nowhere near that time frame.\n\nI am always happy to pay a premium price tag for exceptional service, which is why I was excited to try the location and service out. I am extremely disappointed and I did not receive anywhere near the level of service I expect for The price I paid.

We saw the big five National Parks plus Great Basin NP, Dead Horse Point State Park, Mesa Verde NP, Canyon of the Ancients NM, The Million Dollar Hwy (Telluride-Ouray-Silverton-Durango), Mount Evans, and Dinosaur NM. 2 adults and 2 teenagers.\nPros: The large Wandervan was just right for our needs: slept all of us comfortably (the beds were quite comfortable!) and made it so that we didn't have to put up tents at a new campground every night--we could just roll in after a full day and climb into bed. The second row seating arrangement was great for our teenagers. A Coleman cook stove was included, along with a folding table (which we didn't need becuase we camped in campgrounds that had picnic tables). Camp chairs were provided for the four of us to sit around the fire and the radiate campfire was surprisingly effective (we were skeptical when we first saw it was essentially a cookie tin with wax and wicks). The fridge was great and kept our groceries cool, while the extra cooler we requested (and received) held extra water. There were lots of cup holders and little stoarge pockets to use while driving/riding. The van handled nicely despite its size on a variety of road types--long stretches of highway, the climb up to Mt. Evans, dirt forest service roads, interstates, and city roads in denver and SLC. The backup camera is the best we've ever seen and the blind spot mirrors are SO helpful. The van garnered MUCH attention--everywhere we went people asked us about it. Reservations were easy to make and all contacts with the company have been professional and courteous and responsive.\nCons: We did not receive a couple of items we requested and the contactless checkout left us confused as to how to get those items. The phone number on the printed manual in the glove compartment was not correct. While I understand the contactless checkout procedures, it was very odd and uncomfortable to be picking up and dropping off without seeing a single live person (even the office at the lot was empty and locked up). However, when we notified the company once we returned the van, they credited us the charges against our extra mileage. We had a small maintenance issue, which was rectified easily through the roadside assistance line with the additional insurance we purchased. The fridge kept coming unplugged and turning off the first few days until we figured out that the cord was doubled up behind it, making it stretch too far and come loose wehen my daughter jostled it with her feet where she was sitting. After we figured that out and put the slack back in, we had no further issues with the fridge. The large van is tall and that led to it being buffetted by high winds on straight Utah highways--not really something that can be fixed, but consider it when renting and adjust your driving accordingly. There is no air-conditioning when not running the engine, so sleeping can be hot (especially if you're in Southern Utah during a heat wave). The top bunk has zero ventilation so the heat there was especially bad. Rechargeable fans helped some and screens for the front windows helped some. The back screen didn't really fit well so we didn't use it. If building out new vans a window that opens on the roof or top bunk area would be a nice addition. The large van has limited storage to accommodate for the two beds, but if you plan well it's not a problem.\nAll-in-all, we would definitely do it again--it truly hits the sweet spot between tents and RV.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWjECqGC0eCzINvkvw8gJnM23i7RdFzJxcXvG5=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8752f6a5524b4211:0x3e36cd92537e106c", "relevant": "Yes"}
